0400:  of tests are available for screening for ASD in children younge

01c0: r ASD include behavioral, medical, educational, speech/language,
0200:  and occupational therapy and complementary and alternative medi
0240: cine approaches. Treatments for young children in the target age

0000: estions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>Poten

0080: cause significant social, communication, and behavioral challeng

0100: members and other caregivers. Treatment and maturation may reduc

0180:  others may experience long-term effects on education, employmen
01c0: t, and ability to live independently.<sup>2</sup> It is importan
0200: t that clinicians listen carefully to parents when concerns are 
0240: raised by the parents or during an examination and make prompt u
0280: se of validated tools to assess the need for further diagnostic 
02c0: testing and services. Disparities have been observed in the freq

0340: thnicity, socioeconomic status, and language of origin, creating
0380:  concern that certain groups of children with ASD may be systema

0400:  an \"I\" statement is not a recommendation for or against scree

0000: outcomes measured, as well as by the heterogeneity in the age, t
0040: ypes of symptoms, and symptom severity of the children enrolled.
0080:  Four RCTs reported cognitive and language outcomes for early in
00c0: tensive behavioral interventions delivered by trained clinicians
0100: . Three of the 4 trials (including the largest trial, with 294 c
0140: hildren) reported that these interventions improved cognitive sc
0180: ores by 11 to 16 points (Mullen Scales of Early Learning or IQ) 
01c0: compared with a range of comparators (calculated from published 
0200: data).<sup>13-15</sup> The fourth RCT found no effect, but this 
0240: trial compared different ways of delivering the same interventio
0280: n.<sup>16</sup> The same set of studies showed a similar pattern
02c0:  for language outcomes. Twelve RCTs of play- or interaction-base
0300: d interventions reported significant improvements in some measur
0340: es of interaction but not others. The other RCTs evaluated vario
0380: us interventions delivered by parents and found inconsistent or 
03c0: negative results. Studies were very small (most enrolled 20&ndas
0400: h;40 children), and study quality was generally fair.</p>\r\n<p>
0440: In addition to the limitations of the evidence in size, study de

0000: reening. Autism spectrum disorder is a highly heterogeneous cond
0040: ition in terms of onset and course of core clinical ASD symptoms

00c0:  treatment studies were conducted in populations of children wit
0100: h a previous diagnosis of ASD, many of whom were referred from s

0240: n identified through screening rather than through case-finding 
0280: are likely to be younger and have milder symptoms than those in 
02c0: study populations. It is therefore not clear whether young child
0300: ren with ASD detected by screening and not because of parental o

03c0: tment</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found little evidence on the harms o
0400: f screening and treatment. Potential harms include misdiagnosis 
0440: and the time, effort, and anxiety associated with further testin
0480: g after a positive screening result. This is of particular conce
04c0: rn when there is a delay in confirmatory testing because of reso

0000: tions, which are common.<sup>2</sup> Even good-quality studies o
0040: f screening had a high dropout rate between screening steps and 
0080: between screening and diagnosis, suggesting that the process may
00c0:  be difficult for some families. Behavioral treatments are not g
0100: enerally thought to be associated with significant harms but can
0140:  place a large time and financial burden on the family. Other tr
0180: eatments for ASD are less well studied and were not included in 
01c0: the scope of this review. The USPSTF conclude
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: s that the potential harms of screening and behavioral treatment
0040:  are no greater than small.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Estimate of Magni
0080: tude of Net Benefit</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Overall, the USPSTF foun
00c0: d insufficient evidence on screening for ASD in children aged 18
0100:  to 30 months for whom no concerns of ASD have been raised by pa
0140: rents, other caregivers, or health care professionals. The USPST
0180: F identified no studies that directly evaluated the benefits or 
01c0: harms of screening for ASD in this age group. Studies on the ben
0200: efits and harms of treatment were of small size, few were random
0240: ized, and all were conducted in populations that may not represe
0280: nt children who would be detected through screening programs alo
02c0: ne. The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to 
0300: assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for ASD in
0340:  young children.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n<
0380: p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted fo
03c0: r public comment on the USPSTF website from August 4, 2015, to A
0400: ugust 31, 2015. Many parents of children with ASD, adults with A
0440: SD, and clinicians who care for children with ASD wrote to share
0480:  their personal experiences and concerns. One major area of conc
04c0: ern was a perception that the USPSTF was advocating against scre
0500: ening or ag
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: ainst the use of screening tools to follow up on parents&rsquo; 
0040: concerns. This was not the USPSTF&rsquo;s intention, and the USP
0080: STF will be clear when communicating this recommendation that it
00c0:  is not recommending for or against screening but advocating for
0100:  more research. In the meantime, clinicians should use their cli
0140: nical judgment, especially when caring for populations in which 
0180: case-finding may be difficult because of language, access, or ot
01c0: her barriers. Furthermore, clinicians should listen carefully to
0200:  parents&rsquo; concerns and use validated tools to assess wheth
0240: er further diagnosis or services are needed. Standardized tools,
0280:  such as the M-CHAT, may be used diagnostically to follow up on 
02c0: concerns expressed by parents.</p>\r\n<p>Another area of concern
0300:  was why studies of test accuracy and the effectiveness of treat
0340: ment were not sufficient to support screening and what kind of r
0380: esearch would be needed to support a positive recommendation. In
03c0:  response, the USPSTF revised the recommendation statement to cl
0400: arify the lack of treatment studies in the population that would
0440:  likely be identified through screening and to provide greater d
0480: etail about the different types of studies that could fill this 
04c0: evidentiary gap. Finally, other comments focused on the low cost
0500:  and lack o
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: f harms associated with screening. The USPSTF revised the recomm
0040: endation statement to clarify that, while the screening tools ar
0080: e relatively easy to administer and behavioral interventions are
00c0:  generally safe, the potential effects of extended treatment, in
0100:  the absence of clear benefit, on families in terms of time and 
0140: resources are not negligible.</p>","topic":"Autism Spectrum Diso

0440:  common cause of hearing loss in older adults. However, hearing

0300: hesitancy, urgency, dysuria, or nocturia) are not strictly asymp

0080: tment</h3>\r\n<p>Once bladder cancer has been diagnosed, several
00c0:  factors determine treatment, including tumor grade, cancer stag
0100: e (superficial vs. invasive), whether the tumor is recurrent, th
0140: e patient's age and overall health status, and patient and physi
0180: cian preferences. The principal treatment for superficial (Ta or
01c0:  T1) bladder cancer is transurethral resection of the bladder tu
0200: mor, which may be combined with adjuvant radiation therapy, intr
0240: avesical chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or photodynamic therapies.
0280:  Radical cystectomy, often with adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic
02c0:  chemotherapy, is used in cases of surgically resectable invasiv
0300: e bladder cancer.</p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding 
0340: I Statement</h3>\r\n<p>In deciding whether to screen for bladder
0380:  cancer, clinicians should consider the following.</p>\r\n<h4><e
03c0: m>Potential Preventable Burden</em></h4>\r\n<p>Bladder cancer is
0400:  similar to many other types of cancer in that it is a heterogen
0440: eous condition. Approximately 70% of all cases of newly diagnose
0480: d transitional cell carcinomas present as superficial tumors (in
04c0: cluding in situ); some of these tumors may never progress to adv

<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: se. However, some cases of bladder cancer invade the muscle tiss
0040: ue, progress, and metastasize; treatment has limited efficacy in
0080:  these cases. Early detection of tumors with malignant potential
00c0:  may have an important effect on the mortality rate of bladder c
0100: ancer. One challenge of screening for bladder cancer is accurate
0140: ly identifying cases of early-stage cancer (subepithelial and in
0180:  situ) with a high risk for progression. Another area of uncerta
01c0: inty is determining whether providing earlier, less toxic treatm
0200: ent (such as immunotherapy) with the intention of preventing sym
0240: ptomatic progression results in fewer overall harms to the patie
0280: nt than providing more toxic treatment (such as radical cystecto
02c0: my) only to those patients who develop symptomatic or advanced t
0300: umors. Persons at increased risk for bladder cancer include thos
0340: e who work in the rubber, chemical, or leather industries, as we
0380: ll as those who smoke, are male, are older, or have a family or 
03c0: personal history of bladder cancer.</p>\r\n<h4><em>Potential Har
0400: ms</em></h4>\r\n<p>False-positive test results may result in anx
0440: iety and unneeded evaluations, diagnostic-related harms from cys
0480: toscopy and biopsy, harms from labeling or unnecessary treatment
04c0: s (such as transurethral resection of a bladder tumor, intravesi
0500: cal chemoth
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: erapy, or biologic therapies), and overdiagnosis.</p>\r\n<h4><em
0040: >Current Practice</em></h4>\r\n<p>Screening tests feasible for u
0080: se in primary care include urine dipstick or microscopic urinaly
00c0: sis for hematuria, urine cytology, and tests for urine biomarker
0100: s. Tests for urine biomarkers are not commonly used in primary c
0140: are in part because of their cost, although this varies substant
0180: ially. Patients with positive screening results are typically re
01c0: ferred to a urologist for further evaluation, which may include 
0200: cystoscopy (and biopsy if a tumor is found), imaging, and other 
0240: studies.</p><h2>Other Considerations</h2><h3>Research Needs and 
0280: Gaps</h3>\r\n<p>Several gaps in the evidence led the USPSTF to i
02c0: ssue an I statement. Addressing these research needs could poten
0300: tially provide sufficient evidence for the USPSTF to issue futur
0340: e screening recommendations. Cohort studies are needed to evalua

0180: cancer because of patient characteristics or occupational exposu
01c0: re may be preferred to enhance feasibility and maximize clinical
0200:  relevance. A better understanding of the harms related to scree
0240: ning and treatment are required. Methods for evaluating these ha
0280: rms could include conducting observational studies based on pati
02c0: ent registries or large pharmacoepidemiologic databases. As note
0300: d, prospective cohort studies are needed to more accurately iden
0340: tify cases of early-stage cancer (subepithelial and in situ) wit

0240: balance of benefits and harms (see the full CISNET report for mo

02c0: 1) annual screening with FIT, 2) screening every 10 years with f

0000: hods may be more or less attractive for patients based on their 
0040: features. For example, colonoscopy requires a relatively greater
0080:  time commitment over a short period (bowel preparation, procedu
00c0: re, and recovery) but allows for much longer time between screen
0100: ings compared with stool-based screening. Stool-based screening 
0140: requires persons to handle their feces, which may be difficult f
0180: or some, but the test is quick and noninvasive and can be done a
01c0: t home (the sample is mailed to the laboratory for testing). Fle
0200: xible sigmoidoscopy combined with annual FIT may be an attractiv
0240: e option for persons who want reassurance from endoscopic screen
0280: ing but want to limit their exposure to colonoscopy. Given the l
02c0: ack of evidence from head-to-head comparative trials that any of
0300:  the screening strategies have a greater net benefit than the ot
0340: hers, clinicians should consider engaging patients in informed d

01c0: changes as children reach school age and beyond. In addition, as
0200:  children grow older, dental professionals use sealants rather t
0240: han fluoride varnish. As such, the USPSTF limited its review of 
0280: the evidence of preventive interventions for dental caries to th

0180:  low socioeconomic status, recent maternal caries, sibling carie

02c0: gher-risk populations, the provision of varnish to all children 
0300: is reasonable since the prevalence of risk factors is high in th
0340: e U.S. population, the number needed to treat is low, and the ha
0380: rms of the intervention are small to none.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USP

04c0: age 5 years, clinicians should consider the following.</p>\r\n\r
0500: \n<h4>Poten
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: tial Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Dental caries is the most
0040:  common chronic disease in children in the United States. It is 
0080: four times more common than childhood asthma and seven times mor
00c0: e common than hay fever. According to the NHANES, the prevalence
0100:  of dental caries has risen from 24% to 28% between 1988&ndash;1
0140: 994 and 1999&ndash;2004 <sup>2</sup>. Approximately 20% of surve
0180: yed children with caries had not received treatment. Symptomatic
01c0:  dental caries in children are associated with pain, loss of tee
0200: th, impaired growth, and decreased weight gain and can affect ap
0240: pearance, self-esteem, speech, and school performance. Dental-re
0280: lated concerns lead to the loss of more than 54 million school h
02c0: ours each year <sup>16</sup>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4
0300: >\r\n\r\n<p>No studies examined the harms of performing primary 
0340: care screening examinations for dental caries in children from b
0380: irth to age 5 years <sup>8, 9</sup>. However, given the noninvas
03c0: ive nature of an oral examination, these harms are expected to b
0400: e minimal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In one
0440:  study, only about half of pediatricians reported examining the 
0480: teeth of half of their patients ages 0 to 3 years <sup>17</sup>.

0500:  April 2013
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: , the Community Preventive Services Task Force recommended fluor
0040: idation of community water sources based on strong evidence of e
0080: ffectiveness in reducing dental caries <sup>18</sup>. It also re
00c0: commends school-based dental sealant delivery programs to preven
0100: t caries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Xylitol may have promise as an additiona
0140: l method to reduce the risk for dental caries. Xylitol is classi
0180: fied by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a dietary suppl
01c0: ement and is found in over-the-counter consumer products such as
0200:  wipes or gum. A single small, fair-quality trial of xylitol wip
0240: es use in children ages 6 to 35 months found a 91% relative redu
0280: ction in decayed, missing, or filled surface increment <sup>19</

03c0: 3>\r\n\r\n<p>In deciding whether to screen for MDD in children a
0400: ged 11 years or younger, primary care providers should consider 
0440: the following issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burde
0480: n</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Little is known about the prevalence of MDD in 
04c0: children aged 11 years or younger. The mean age of onset of MDD 
0500: is about 14
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000:  to 15 years. Early onset is associated with worse outcomes. The
0040:  average duration of a depressive episode in childhood varies wi
0080: dely, from 2 to 17 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r
00c0: \n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of sc
0100: reening for MDD in children. The USPSTF concluded that screening
0140:  itself is unlikely to be associated with significant harms, asi
0180: de from opportunity costs, labeling and potential stigma associa
01c0: ted with a positive result, and referral for further evaluation 
0200: and treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concluded, on the basis 
0240: of a previous review, that the use of SSRIs in children is assoc
0280: iated with harms, specifically risk for suicidality. Evidence on
02c0:  the harms of psychotherapy alone or in combination with SSRIs i
0300: n children is limited. Newer studies provide little additional e
0340: vidence on treatment harms in children and adolescents but do no
0380: t suggest more risks. Only 4 studies examined the harms of treat
03c0: ment with SSRIs in children and adolescents. These studies found
0400:  no increased risk for suicidality associated with antidepressan
0440: t use, but risk for rare events could not be precisely determine
0480: d because the studies had limited statistical power. No trials o

0080: re for screening for MDD in children.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Additional 
00c0: Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Community Preventive
0100:  Services Task Force recommends collaborative care for the manag
0140: ement of depressive disorders, based on strong evidence of effec
0180: tiveness in improving depression symptoms, adherence and respons

0300: \n<p>In a separate recommendation statement, the USPSTF conclude
0340: d that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balanc

0000: tation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many screening tools are available to iden
0040: tify depression in children and adolescents, and some have been 
0080: used in primary care. The number of items in each tool, the admi
00c0: nistrative time required to complete them, and the appropriate a
0100: ges for screening vary. A positive result on an initial screenin
0140: g test does not necessarily indicate the need for treatment. Scr
0180: eening is usually done in 2 phases: the initial screening is fol
01c0: lowed by a second phase in which skilled clinicians take into ac
0200: count contextual factors surrounding the patient&rsquo;s current
0240:  situation, through either additional probing or a formal diagno
0280: stic interview. In instances where treatment is recommended, it 
02c0: can be initiated by the screening provider or through referral t
0300: o another set of treatment providers. A negative result on a scr
0340: eening test, however, does not always preclude referral when cli
0380: nical judgment or parental concerns suggest it is warranted.</p>
03c0: \r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends that screening be implemented w
0400: ith adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effe
0440: ctive treatment, and appropriate follow-up. Depression can be ma
0480: naged in the primary care or specialist setting or collaborative
04c0: ly in both settings. Treatment options for depression include ph
0500: armacologic
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: , behavioral, multimodal, and collaborative care models, some of
0040:  which require coordination. Finally, inadequate support and fol
0080: low-up may result in treatment failures or harms, as indicated b
00c0: y the FDA boxed warning. &ldquo;Adequate systems in place&rdquo;
0100:  refers to having systems and clinical staff to ensure that pati
0140: ents are screened and, if they screen positive, are appropriatel
0180: y diagnosed and treated with evidence-based care or referred to 
01c0: a setting that can provide the necessary care. These essential f
0200: unctions can be provided through a wide range of arrangements of
0240:  clinician types and settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Research Needs and
0280:  Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The systematic evidence review identified s
02c0: everal critical research gaps, including the need for studies of
0300:  screening for and treatment of MDD in children younger than 11 
0340: years. Large, good-quality randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) 
0380: are also needed to better understand the overarching effects of 
03c0: screening for MDD on intermediate and long-term health outcomes.
0400:  It would be helpful to quantify the proportion of persons with 
0440: screen-detected MDD who are treated or referred as well as their
0480:  willingness and ability to be assessed and treated.</p>\r\n\r\n
04c0: <p>The systematic review excluded studies with participants who 
0500: had comorbi
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: d disorders. Children and adolescents with MDD more often have c
0040: omorbid conditions than those without MDD, particularly in prima
0080: ry care settings. This underscores the importance of additional 
00c0: research in child and adolescent populations that are similar to
0100:  those found in primary care settings to study the effects of co
0140: morbid conditions on screening accuracy, type of MDD treatment s
0180: elected, and benefits and harms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For treatment of 
01c0: MDD, research needs include well-designed studies of psychothera
0200: py and combined treatments, as well as studies of the benefits a
0240: nd harms of other treatments (such as non-SSRI medications and c
0280: omplementary or alternative approaches). For rare events, meta-a
02c0: nalyses are needed that include only children and adolescents wi

0140: the United States. In the 2-step approach, the 50-g OGCT is perf
0180: ormed between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation in a nonfasting state
01c0: . If the screening threshold is met or exceeded (130, 135, or 14
0200: 0 mg/dL [7.21, 7.49, or 7.77 mmol/L]), patients receive the oral
0240:  glucose tolerance test (OGTT). During the OGTT, a fasting gluco
0280: se level is obtained, followed by administration of a 100-g gluc
02c0: ose load, and glucose levels are evaluated after 1, 2, and 3 hou
0300: rs. A diagnosis of GDM is made when 2 or more glucose values fal

03c0:  fasting and plasma glucose levels are evaluated after 1 and 2 h

03c0: USPSTF did not consider the available observational evidence on 
0400: the effectiveness of mammography screening, and that the USPSTF&
0440: rsquo;s assessment is therefore based on outdated information, r
0480: esulting in an underestimate of the current benefits of screenin
04c0: g. This is incorrect. The systematic evidence review, which serv
0500: ed as the f
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: oundation for this recommendation statement, encompassed both RC
0040: Ts and nonexperimental studies of mammography screening. Nearly 
0080: 200 observational studies, including 83 that specifically evalua
00c0: ted the benefits of screening mammography, were captured in the 
0100: review.<sup>2</sup> The USPSTF agrees that more contemporary evi
0140: dence on breast cancer screening is important to consider given 
0180: the age of the available RCTs, and it reviewed both the recent P
01c0: an-Canadian<sup>44</sup> and the Swedish Mammography Screening i
0200: n Young Women<sup>45</sup> cohort studies. As noted in the Discu
0240: ssion section, RCTs of mammography screening have generally foun
0280: d smaller relative reductions in breast cancer mortality than ob
02c0: servational studies, although estimates from the latter vary. Fo
0300: r example, meta-analyses of mammography screening in women aged 
0340: 50 to 69 years showed RRs of breast cancer death ranging from 0.
0380: 78 to 0.81 in RCTs compared with about 0.69 to 0.75 in observati
03c0: onal studies.<sup>2</sup> There may be several reasons for this 
0400: difference in the magnitude of benefit. Improvements in mammogra
0440: phy technology may be translating into an increased mortality be
0480: nefit, so that more recent observational evidence demonstrates a
04c0:  real difference in the efficacy of modern-day screening compare
0500: d with that
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000:  of the older randomized trials. However, known and important me
0040: thodological limitations of observational studies, such as selec
0080: tion bias, lead and length time bias, and residual or unknown bi
00c0: as and confounding, are likely explanations for some or even all
0100:  of the difference observed. In the absence of a modern-day clin
0140: ical trial, it is impossible to know with certainty the precise 
0180: magnitude of benefit of current screening mammography programs. 
01c0: As such, the USPSTF believes it is most appropriate to consider 
0200: all of the evidence available (given that it meets prespecified 
0240: and transparent quality standards, such as those delineated in i
0280: ts commissioned systematic evidence review),<sup>2</sup> while a
02c0: cknowledging that uncertainty remains about the exact size of th
0300: e anticipated benefit in either direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Screen
0340: ing Mammography in Women Aged 40 to 49 Years</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Some
0380:  commenters incorrectly believed that the &ldquo;C&rdquo; recomm
03c0: endation for women aged 40 to 49 years represented a change from
0400:  what the USPSTF had recommended in the past. Others thought tha
0440: t the &ldquo;C&rdquo; recommendation meant that the USPSTF was r
0480: ecommending against screening in this group of women. As noted p
04c0: reviously, the recommendation for women aged 40 to 49 years was 
0500: also a &ldq
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: uo;C&rdquo; in 2009 (meaning that the USPSTF had concluded that 
0040: it had moderate certainty of a small net benefit to mammography 
0080: screening in this population). This update clarifies the languag
00c0: e around what the &ldquo;C&rdquo; recommendation means. It is <e
0100: m>not</em> a recommendation against screening but a statement th
0140: at the decision to undergo screening mammography for women in th
0180: eir 40s should be an informed, individual one, after she weighs 
01c0: the potential benefit against the potential harms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h
0200: 4>Screening Mammography in Women Aged 70 to 74 Years or Older</h
0240: 4>\r\n\r\n<p>Several commenters believed that the USPSTF was inc
0280: onsistent in extending a &ldquo;B&rdquo; recommendation to women
02c0:  aged 70 to 74 years but assigning an &ldquo;I&rdquo; statement 
0300: to women aged 75 years or older. These commenters noted that alt
0340: hough the USPSTF had explained that trial data were inconclusive
0380:  for women in their early 70s, modeling data could support exten
03c0: ding the benefit seen in younger women to this age range. Howeve
0400: r, the USPSTF had stated that modeling data were not sufficient 
0440: to establish the benefits of mammography screening in women aged
0480:  75 years or older. This is an apparent, though not real, contra
04c0: diction. Two RCTs of mammography screening included participants
0500:  aged 70 to
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000:  74 years. A meta-analysis performed to support the 2002 USPSTF 
0040: recommendations found that the RR reduction of breast cancer dea
0080: th in screened women aged 65 to 74 years was 0.78 (CI, 0.62 to 0
00c0: .99).<sup>35</sup> In 2009 and 2014, the meta-analyses were rest
0100: ricted to women aged 70 to 74 years. In the most recent update, 
0140: the meta-analysis showed an RR reduction of 0.80 (CI, 0.51 to 1.
0180: 28),<sup>2</sup> and the CI widened and crossed 1.0 because of t
01c0: he small number of absolute participants included in the analysi
0200: s. The USPSTF considered the trial data, which were suggestive b
0240: ut not definitive, showing a benefit to mammography in this age 
0280: group within the context of the modeling data, which also sugges
02c0: ted an absolute breast cancer mortality benefit (with reasonable
0300:  additional harms) with the extension of screening to this age g
0340: roup. In women aged 75 years or older, however, direct evidence 
0380: about the benefits of screening mammography does not exist; no c
03c0: linical trials of screening include this population.<sup>2</sup>
0400:  Therefore, in this case, the USPSTF&rsquo;s assessment could no
0440: t rest on a foundation of empirical data augmented with suppleme
0480: ntal information, but would have to be entirely based on decisio
04c0: n modeling. The USPSTF does not use evidence from models alone t
0500: o establish
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000:  that a clinical preventive service is effective or harmful; rat
0040: her, it uses modeling as an important extension that builds on o
0080: bserved evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Definition of Overdiagnosis</h4
00c0: >\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF received several comments about how overd
0100: iagnosis was conceptualized in the recommendation statement. Com
0140: menters stressed that it is impossible to directly measure overd
0180: iagnosis, and that there are multiple methods for estimating its
01c0:  frequency but no scientific consensus on the optimal approach. 
0200: The USPSTF agrees, and it discusses these issues in several plac
0240: es throughout the recommendation. Commenters emphasized that bec
0280: ause it is not possible to know whether any individual screen-de
02c0: tected cancer would have been clinically detected or gone on to 
0300: cause health problems in the absence of screening, clinicians tr
0340: eat all detected breast cancer as potentially lethal; again, the
0380:  USPSTF concurs. Commenters disagreed about the degree of overdi
03c0: agnosis that is likely to occur with the use of mammography scre
0400: ening, and the USPSTF received requests to emphasize percentages
0440:  that are both higher and lower than the 19% estimate derived fr
0480: om the trials that did not have screening in their control group
04c0: s at the end of the study. For the sake of transparency, the USP
0500: STF has pro
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: vided the full range of overdiagnosis estimates available in the
0040:  literature as identified in its commissioned systematic evidenc
0080: e review, as well as specific estimates from observational studi
00c0: es, randomized trials, and modeling studies, with the clear cave
0100: at that ongoing uncertainty remains. This uncertainty is <em>not
0140: </em> about the fundamental existence of this critical harm of m
0180: ammography screening,<sup>46</sup> as a few commenters suggested
01c0: ; rather, it is about the precise magnitude of the problem. The 
0200: USPSTF notes that continuing research is essential to advance un
0240: derstanding of the magnitude of overdiagnosis and how to disting
0280: uish overdiagnosed cancer from cancer that is likely to progress
02c0: , as well as to reduce its occurrence.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>DBT</h4>\r
0300: \n\r\n<p>Some commenters thought the USPSTF overlooked evidence 
0340: in its review of the efficacy of DBT. Commenters noted that stud
0380: ies have shown that DBT increases the detection of breast cancer
03c0:  and reduces recalls and false-positive results. The USPSTF comm
0400: issioned a systematic evidence review on DBT as a primary screen
0440: ing method for breast cancer.<sup>13</sup> The original search i
0480: dentified 945 studies, of which only 13 were identified as speci
04c0: fically relevant to the topic at hand. A bridge search performed
0500:  during the
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000:  public comment period to keep the review as temporally current 
0040: as possible identified another 79 studies, 5 of which directly a
0080: ddressed the test characteristics of DBT. Despite this expansive
00c0:  and meticulous search, a single study met the prespecified incl
0100: usion criteria (studies must be conducted in a screening populat
0140: ion of asymptomatic women aged 40 years or older and must evalua
0180: te test performance characteristics against a comprehensive refe
01c0: rence standard that is applied to both negative and positive tes
0200: t results). A &ldquo;comprehensive reference standard&rdquo; mea
0240: ns that further imaging and/or biopsy is performed for positive 
0280: results, and there is a minimum of 1 year of clinical follow-up 
02c0: for negative results in order to accurately assess the interval 
0300: breast cancer rate (that is, the number of cancers that appear i
0340: n between screening periods, which allows for the calculation of
0380:  false-negative results). Even though no other studies met these
03c0:  inclusion criteria, the USPSTF still carefully reviewed the dat
0400: a from all of the studies identified as directly relevant to the
0440:  use of DBT for primary breast cancer screening, including Fried
0480: ewald and colleagues&#39; 2014 study that evaluated the performa
04c0: nce of DBT in combination with conventional digital mammography.

0000: p> As already noted in the Clinical Considerations section, the 
0040: USPSTF agrees that preliminary evidence suggests that DBT can re
0080: duce recall rates for false-positive results (median reduction, 
00c0: 1.7% [range in the systematic review, 0.6% to 7.2%]).<sup>13</su
0100: p> The USPSTF also agrees that DBT appears to increase the cance
0140: r detection rate compared with conventional digital mammography 
0180: alone. However, the rate of overdiagnosis associated with DBT is
01c0:  unknown; it is also unknown if there is an incremental benefit 
0200: to finding these cancers earlier than with conventional digital 
0240: mammography. The USPSTF recommends continued research around thi
0280: s emerging technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Comparison of the USPSTF&r
02c0: squo;s Recommendations With Those of Other Organizations</h4>\r\
0300: n\r\n<p>Some commenters noted that the USPSTF recommendations on
0340:  breast cancer screening do not align with those of other organi
0380: zations, such as the American College of Radiology<sup>48</sup> 
03c0: or the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists<sup>
0400: 49</sup>&mdash;both of whom recommend annual mammography screeni
0440: ng beginning at age 40 years&mdash;and were concerned that the l
0480: ack of conformity may be confusing to clinicians and patients. W
04c0: hile there are some differences, it is worth emphasizing the not
0500: able simila
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: rities in the approach of many major guidelines, including those
0040:  between the USPSTF&rsquo;s recommendations and the recently rel
0080: eased recommendations from the American Cancer Society.<sup>50</
00c0: sup> The USPSTF stands in agreement with most organizations that
0100:  mammography screening can reduce deaths due to breast cancer in
0140:  women in their 40s. Based on the evidence, the USPSTF found tha
0180: t there is a net benefit for women to initiating screening in th
01c0: eir 40s, and that the size of the net benefit is smaller than th
0200: at for older women; it therefore concludes that the decision to 
0240: begin screening should be an individual one. The American Cancer
0280:  Society, along with many other groups, including the American C
02c0: ollege of Physicians,<sup>51</sup> the American Academy of Famil
0300: y Physicians,<sup>52</sup> the 2013 Well-Woman Task Force assemb
0340: led by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,
0380: <sup>53, 54</sup> and the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Heal
03c0: th Care,<sup>55</sup> also recommends individualized decision ma
0400: king for women in their 40s on whether and when to initiate mamm
0440: ography screening. The USPSTF clarified that the risk for breast
0480:  cancer increases with age (so a 48-year-old woman&rsquo;s poten
04c0: tial to benefit may be more similar to a 50- rather than a 40-ye

0000: n), and that women may wish to factor this information into thei
0040: r decision making as they consider whether and when to initiate 
0080: screening in their 40s. Notably, the USPSTF is in agreement with
00c0:  all other major professional organizations about the importance
0100:  of regular mammography screening for women aged 50 to 74 years.
0140:  The USPSTF found that most of the benefit of mammography screen
0180: ing is realized with biennial screening. The newly released reco
01c0: mmendations from the American Cancer Society also support bienni
0200: al screening, at intervals of 1 to 2 years in women in their 50s
0240: , 60s, and 70s.<sup>50</sup> National breast cancer screening pr
0280: ograms in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Pola
02c0: nd, Norway, Luxembourg, Germany, Finland, Denmark, and Belgium o
0300: ffer mammography screening every 2 to 3 years for women aged 50 
0340: up to 74 years.<sup>56</sup> Many European countries adhere to r
0380: ecommendations from the International Agency for Research on Can
03c0: cer, which recently updated its guidelines to promote screening 
0400: starting at age 50 years.<sup>57</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Insurance 
0440: Coverage and Access to Mammography</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Some commenter
0480: s expressed concern that a &ldquo;C&rdquo; recommendation from t
04c0: he USPSTF might create a financial barrier for some women in the
0500: ir 40s who 
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: wish to undergo mammography screening after making an informed d
0040: ecision. These commenters asked the USPSTF to change its recomme
0080: ndation to a &ldquo;B&rdquo; to guarantee insurance coverage for
00c0:  these women. The Affordable Care Act mandates that persons with
0100:  private health plans receive coverage without copayment or coin
0140: surance for preventive services that have a USPSTF &ldquo;A&rdqu
0180: o; or &ldquo;B&rdquo; recommendation.<sup>58</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p
01c0: >Recommendations from the USPSTF are based on its interpretation
0200:  of the science regarding the potential benefits and harms of a 
0240: preventive service; a &ldquo;C&rdquo; recommendation means that 
0280: the USPSTF has concluded that there is at least moderate certain
02c0: ty of a small net benefit to the service, whereas a &ldquo;B&rdq
0300: uo; recommendation means that there is either high certainty tha
0340: t the net benefit is moderate or moderate certainty that the net
0380:  benefit is moderate to substantial. The USPSTF found in 2009 an
03c0: d again in 2016 that there is moderate certainty of a small net 
0400: benefit to starting breast cancer screening before age 50 years 
0440: because of the balance of benefit and harms outlined in this rec
0480: ommendation statement. The USPSTF could not give a &ldquo;B&rdqu
04c0: o; recommendation for screening in women aged 40 to 49 years bec
0500: ause the sc
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: ience does not support moderate or high certainty of moderate or
0040:  substantial net benefit in this age group. The role of the USPS
0080: TF is to assess the scientific evidence for preventive services;
00c0:  it is not within its mandate to reinterpret the science and inf
0100: late the net benefit of mammography screening solely to ensure i
0140: nsurance coverage of the service for women with private insuranc
0180: e plans.<sup>59</sup> The USPSTF recommends that women in their 
01c0: 40s who understand the potential harms of mammography screening 
0200: but place a higher value on the potential benefit have the optio
0240: n to begin screening. The USPSTF appreciates that, in the absenc
0280: e of full or partial insurance coverage, fewer women may make th
02c0: at choice, but those determinations are made by payers and legis
0300: lators. Private and public payers have the option of providing c
0340: overage (as most do), and legislators have the option of requiri
0380: ng coverage (as they have done in the past and again in the 2016
03c0:  Consolidated Appropriations Act).<sup>60</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So
0400: me commenters highlighted the importance of coverage without add
0440: itional payment for women with Medicare or Medicaid. Coverage in
0480:  these plans does not reflect USPSTF recommendations and is deci
04c0: ded separately by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Servic
0500: es (for Med
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: icare) and by individual states (for Medicaid).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Co
0040: mmenters also expressed concern that mammography is currently un
0080: derutilized in the United States in some settings (for example, 
00c0: rates of recent use among women aged 50 to 74 years do not meet 
0100: the <em>Healthy People 2020</em> target<sup>61</sup>) and that a
0140: ny recommendation other than annual mammography screening beginn
0180: ing at age 40 years might &ldquo;drive complacency&rdquo; among 
01c0: women and cause them to delay needed attention to their health. 
0200: The most recent trend data from the National Committee for Quali
0240: ty Assurance suggest that mammography screening rates have incre
0280: ased among women in all insurance categories since the USPSTF&rs
02c0: quo;s 2009 recommendation.<sup>62</sup> As with most effective m
0300: edical interventions, there is the potential for underuse, appro
0340: priate use, and overuse of screening mammography in the general 
0380: population. The USPSTF agrees that effective patient, provider, 
03c0: and systems-level interventions should be employed to increase t
0400: he appropriate use of screening mammography among women who are 
0440: most likely to benefit from it, and it feels strongly that women
0480:  need accurate information about potential benefits and harms so

0400: d on an elevated LDL-C level, a diabetes diagnosis, or at least 
0440: 1 CVD risk factor. Use of low- or moderate-dose statins was asso
0480: ciated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (pooled risk r

0080:  a composite cardiovascular outcome (RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.63 to 0

0100: oportion of CVD events prevented (ie, the relative risk reductio

0180:  other risk factor categories.<sup>6</sup> Among trials that str

0340:  on the incidence of disease over time in that population. In ot

00c0: p>The reviewed studies used various screening tools. One example
0100:  is the Suicide Risk Screen, a 20-item screening instrument embe
0140: dded in a broader self-report questionnaire administered in high
0180:  schools to youths at risk for dropping out of school. Another t

0240: g suicidal&rdquo; within the past month) targeting primary care 
0280: patients aged 18 to 70 years with scheduled appointments.</p>\r\
02c0: n\r\n<p>Sensitivity and specificity of screening tools generally
0300:  ranged from 52% to 100% and from 60% to 98%, respectively. The 
0340: instruments showed a wide range in accuracy, but data were limit
0380: ed and no instruments were examined in more than 1 study <sup>2<
03c0: /sup>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most effective tr
0400: eatments to reduce risk for suicide attempt include psychotherap
0440: y. The most commonly studied psychotherapy intervention was cogn

0000: herapy. Other approaches included psychodynamic or interpersonal
0040:  therapy. Although most of these treatments are not customarily 
0080: administered by primary care providers in the office, patients c
00c0: an be referred to behavioral health providers for them. The prim
0100: ary care provider can play a continued role in the care of these
0140:  patients by monitoring them during the process, providing follo

0200: ddition to approaching the problem of suicide from an individual
0240:  level in primary care, approaches are being implemented at comm
0280: unity, regional, and national levels. In the health care system,
02c0:  laws requiring coverage parity between mental and physical heal
0300: th disorders will give more persons the ability to access care f

0380: ion. Efforts to coordinate care among programs that address ment
03c0: al health, substance use, and physical health can also increase 
0400: access to care. Activities that have been shown to be correlated
0440:  with lower suicide rates in other countries include detoxificat

01c0:  suicide. Of these, 2 were conducted in adolescent populations t

0040: d previously, neither of the studies of adolescents was conducte
0080: d in a primary care setting and both recruited participants who 
00c0: were already at increased risk for suicide. Only 1 of the 4 stud

0280: PSTF found no direct evidence that screening for suicide risk is
02c0:  associated with improved health outcomes in asymptomatic adoles
0300: cents or adults. Although studies evaluating screening were more
0340:  likely to be conducted in a primary care population, studies as
0380: sessing the effectiveness of treatment were predominantly conduc
03c0: ted in patients known to be at high risk. In particular, many tr
0400: eatment studies were of patients with previous suicide attempts 
0440: or a history of mental illness, such as borderline personality d

0080: pproaches to suicide prevention have been evaluated: psychothera
00c0: py, enhanced usual care (approaches designed to improve the qual
0100: ity or format of recommended treatment or improve patient adhere
0140: nce to usual care), and medications. Of these, psychotherapy pro
0180: viding specific treatment approaches showed better outcomes than
01c0:  enhanced usual care; few studies addressed medications. Suicide
0200:  attempts were reduced by a pooled average of 32% in 11 psychoth
0240: erapy trials in adults. Interventions that focused on enhancing 
0280: usual care showed little effect on suicide deaths, suicide attem
02c0: pts, or related outcomes. A single large trial of older primary 
0300: care patients reported a 20% reduction in the relative risk for 
0340: a combined outcome of suicide attempts and ideation; however, th
0380: e study involved education and training of a volunteer sample of
03c0:  general practitioners, who may have been more motivated to impr
0400: ove their practice than a random sample of general practitioners
0440: <sup>18</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMinimal data are available on the
0480:  effectiveness of using medications to prevent suicidal behavior

0500: sed the use
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000:  of lithium (19). The study reported hazard ratios that suggeste
0040: d a possible benefit for suicide attempts but were not statistic
0080: ally significant. There was a statistically significantly lower 
00c0: rate of suicide deaths per patient-year in the intervention grou
0100: p; however, the study had high attrition rates and there were on
0140: ly 3 suicide deaths.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe evidence base for treat
0180: ment interventions in adolescents is limited. Study populations 
01c0: primarily consisted of participants at high risk for suicide, mo
0200: st with recent suicide attempts or acute suicidal ideation. The 
0240: effect of treatment to prevent suicide on suicide deaths could n
0280: ot be determined because there was only 1 death in any of the 3 
02c0: trials that reported this outcome. Suicide attempts were not red
0300: uced with psychotherapy treatment at 6 to 18 months. The CI for 
0340: the pooled effect was wide and crossed zero, ranging from a 25% 
0380: reduction in risk to a 31% increase. Therefore, the possibility 
03c0: of harm or benefit cannot be ruled out with the existing evidenc
0400: e from psychotherapy trials<sup>2</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe sol
0440: e enhanced usual care study in adolescents also had a sample of 
0480: high-risk patients, all of whom had a history of suicide attempt

0080: he groups in suicidal ideation, depression, or hopelessness at t
00c0: he 12-month follow-up, thus providing no evidence of treatment b
0100: enefit.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n\tPotential Harms of Screening</h3>\r\n<p
0140: >\r\n\tThree studies reported on the potential adverse effects o
0180: f screening. One was a trial of adults with depression in 4 prim
01c0: ary care practices in the United Kingdom. The other 2 were condu
0200: cted in high school settings.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the study of ad
0240: ults, no statistically significant increases in suicide attempts
0280:  or ideation were seen at 2 weeks after screening<sup>21</sup>. 
02c0: The trial, however, had a relatively small sample (<em>n</em> = 
0300: 443) and limited power. In addition, differential ascertainment 
0340: may have biased the results; a higher proportion of participants
0380:  who were screened withdrew consent for follow-up (6.6% of scree
03c0: ned vs. 2.2% of unscreened).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn both of the high
0400:  school studies, students were randomly assigned to screening fo
0440: r suicide risk on 1 of 2 occasions 1 to 2 days apart. The items 
0480: used to screen for suicide risk were embedded in an instrument t
04c0: hat addressed broader mental health issues. The larger trial (<e
0500: m>n</em> = 
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: 2342), conducted in 6 high schools in New York, randomly assigne
0040: d the students at the classroom level<sup>22</sup>. No immediate
0080:  increase in students reporting suicidal ideation or mean suicid
00c0: al ideation score was reported.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe second study
0100: , conducted in Australia, was smaller (<em>n</em> = 308) and fou
0140: nd no differences between the 2 groups in anger, confusion, depr
0180: ession, fatigue, or tension based on Profile of Mood States scor
01c0: es immediately after screening for suicide risk or completion of
0200:  other mental health items<sup>23</sup>. &ldquo;Vigor&rdquo; was
0240:  the only characteristic that was reported to be higher in scree
0280: ned participants. After both groups had completed the suicide ri
02c0: sk screening items, 8.9% reported that the suicide-related items
0300:  were &ldquo;moderately distressing&rdquo; or &ldquo;very distre
0340: ssing&rdquo; and 31.5% found them to be &ldquo;a little distress
0380: ing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBecause of the paucity of data and s
03c0: tudy limitations, the possibility of short-term harms from parti
0400: cipation in suicide screening cannot be dismissed, although no s
0440: erious adverse events were documented in the studies. Other pote
0480: ntial harms of screening include harms that may result from trea
04c0: tment in persons with screen-detected risk after referral.</p>\r
0500: \n<p>\r\n\t
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: Few treatment trials in adults reported adverse events. One cogn
0040: itive behavioral therapy trial reported that none of the suicide
0080:  attempts was believed to be a result of study participation<sup
00c0: >24</sup>. In a study of a video-based problem-solving intervent
0100: ion, none of the participants withdrew because of worsening symp
0140: toms<sup>25</sup>. A study of writing as a means for reducing su
0180: icidal ideation reported that 3 participants asked to speak with
01c0:  a supervisor because they became upset after writing or their w
0200: riting reflected current suicidal ideation (26). Not enough data
0240:  were available to draw conclusions on whether harms occurred du
0280: e to screening in adults.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf the 11 adolescent p
02c0: sychotherapy treatment trials reporting suicide attempts, 4 note
0300: d non&ndash;statistically significant increases in suicide attem
0340: pts, ranging from 22% to 113%[[27&ndash;29]]. One was a small tr
0380: ial that had few events and wide CIs associated with the effect;
03c0:  however, the other trials probably had enough events to represe
0400: nt stable but still statistically nonsignificant effects. Thus, 
0440: the possibility of harm due to treatment cannot be ruled out in 
0480: currently or recently suicidal adolescents receiving therapy.</p
04c0: >\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the medication trial that evaluated treatment w

<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: , a higher percentage of participants in the treatment group tha
0040: n in the placebo group withdrew from the study because of advers
0080: e events (13% vs. 2%), although the statistical significance was
00c0:  not reported and overall dropout rates were similar between the
0100:  groups<sup>19</sup>.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n\tEstimate of Magnitude of 
0140: Net Benefit</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe USPSTF found inadequate evidenc
0180: e on the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests for suicide risk
01c0: , the effectiveness of treatment, and the harms of screening or 
0200: treatment. In attempting to build a chain of indirect evidence f
0240: rom screening to treatment to beneficial health outcomes, the li
0280: nk between screening and treatment is problematic because of the
02c0:  poor fit between the populations in the 2 bodies of evidence. T
0300: herefore, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence on the benefits
0340:  and harms of screening is lacking for adolescents, adults, and 
0380: older adults.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n\tResponse to Public Comments</h3>\

0200: </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When used to confirm clinically suspected thyroi
0240: d disease in patients referred to an endocrinologist, the serum 
0280: TSH test has a sensitivity of about 98% and a specificity of abo
02c0: ut 92%.<sup>31</sup> However, its accuracy is more challenging t
0300: o ascertain when it is used to screen asymptomatic persons for t
0340: hyroid dysfunction, for several reasons. First, there is no cons
0380: ensus on the appropriate TSH cutoff for a diagnosis of subclinic
03c0: al hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Most laboratories define a
0400: n abnormal TSH test result by using the upper and lower limits o
0440: f the 95% reference interval for a particular assay (generally a
0480: bout 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L).<sup>3</sup> However, laboratories use va
04c0: rying types of assays.<sup>32</sup> More important, this thresho
0500: ld is arbit
<= Recv data, 1291 bytes (0x50b)
0000: rary; it is not based on the risk for an adverse health outcome 
0040: but simply a normal population distribution of values.</p>\r\n\r
0080: \n<p>Second, TSH secretion varies among different subpopulations
00c0: , such as those defined by race/ethnicity, sex, and age. For exa
0100: mple, 12% of persons aged 80 years or older with no evidence of 
0140: thyroid disease have been found to have TSH levels greater than 
0180: 4.5 mIU/L.<sup>33</sup> Therefore the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; pop

0240: s highly sensitive to factors other than thyroid disorders. For 
0280: example, serum TSH is frequently suppressed during phases of acu
02c0: te illness.<sup>3</sup> Levels of TSH may also be affected by th
0300: e administration of drugs or substances, such as iodine, dopamin
0340: e, glucocorticoids, octreotide, or bexarotene.<sup>1, 15</sup> A
0380: drenal insufficiency, pregnancy (particularly during the first t

0240: Implementation</h3>\n\n<p>Screening with the TST requires that p

0300: s should plan with patients accordingly to ensure they can retur

0380: sults within the proper time frame.<sup>26</sup> Screening with 
03c0: an IGRA requires obtaining a single venous blood sample, and pat
0400: ients do not need to return for interpretation of results. Howev

0140: among MSM, and approximately one-half of all MSM diagnosed with 
0180: syphilis were also coinfected with HIV. Increased prevalence of

0200:  the perception that the USPSTF was recommending against perform

0140: er (about 19% of the eligible population) received a single clin

01c0: 48% relative reduction in the risk of dying from melanoma in the
0200:  region that instituted the interventions compared with the cont

0000: region receiving the interventions was already declining prior t
0040: o the introduction of the cancer screening program. This also su
0080: ggests that the 48% relative reduction overestimates the true ef
00c0: fect size of screening. Several other data points raise question
0100: s about the plausibility of the observed effect: 1) only 19% of 
0140: the total eligible population was actually screened, and 37% of 
0180: these individuals were lost to follow-up, yet the relative magni
01c0: tude of the mortality reduction in the population is larger than
0200:  in almost any other cancer screening intervention currently ava
0240: ilable; and 2) three-fourths of the population screened were wom
0280: en, yet equal reductions in melanoma mortality were observed amo
02c0: ng both men and women.<sup>15</sup> Furthermore, an independent 
0300: study evaluating an additional 5 years of follow-up in the SCREE
0340: N study population found that the observed reduction in melanoma

0e80: l harms of screening for OSA in asymptomatic adults seen in prim
0ec0: ary care, including those with unrecognized symptoms. The system

0f40: s of treatment of OSA on intermediate outcomes (eg, change in AH
0f80: I, sleepiness, and blood pressure) and health outcomes (eg, mort
0fc0: ality, quality of life, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event
1000: s, and cognitive impairment). The review focused on studies in a
1040: dults 18 years and older and excluded children, adolescents, and
1080:  pregnant women.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening and Diagno
10c0: stic Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Several screening questionnaires and c
1100: linical prediction tools have been developed to identify persons
1140:  who are at higher risk of OSA. The USPSTF found evidence on 2 t
1180: ools that have been evaluated in primary care or general populat
11c0: ions (vs referral populations): the Berlin Questionnaire and the
1200:  MVAP tool.<sup>1</sup> The Berlin Questionnaire was evaluated i
1240: n a single cross-sectional study that sampled Norwegian resident
1280: s from the National Population Register; 16,302 participants com
12c0: pleted the questionnaire, and 518 went on to have polysomnograph

1340:  of high-risk participants, the Berlin Questionnaire had a sensi
1380: tivity of 37.2% (95% CI, 36.0% to 38.4%) and a specificity of 84
13c0: .0% (95% CI, 83.2% to 84.7%) when using an AHI cutpoint of 5 or 
1400: greater. Using an AHI cutpoint of 15 or greater, the Berlin Ques
1440: tionnaire had a sensitivity of 43.0% (95% CI, 41.2% to 44.8%) an
1480: d a specificity of 79.7% (95% CI, 79.0% to 80.5%).<sup>1,16</sup
14c0: > Overall, the study found poor accuracy. In addition, this sing
1500: le study has not been externally validated and was found to have
1540:  moderate risk of bias due to missing data, attrition bias, and 
1580: spectrum bias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two studies evaluated the MVAP tool
15c0:  in community or primary care settings. Although both studies we

1800: study as an AHI &ge;30 and ESS score &gt;10).<sup>17</sup> Among
1840:  patients with hypertension, the MVAP tool had a sensitivity of

1980: sup> in the study of Medicare patients, while sensitivity decrea
19c0: sed to 88.2%, specificity increased to 71.6% among patients with
1a00:  hypertension.<sup>18</sup> The 2 studies that evaluated the MVA
1a40: P tool were conducted in populations that had a high prevalence 
1a80: of OSAS (and thus were more likely to be symptomatic) and a high
1ac0:  risk of spectrum bias (ie, the study population does not repres
1b00: ent the general primary care population).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPS
1b40: TF also evaluated the evidence on the accuracy of diagnostic tes
1b80: ts for OSA. In particular, it evaluated the evidence on the vari
1bc0: ous types of portable sleep monitors compared with polysomnograp
1c00: hy. Evidence was obtained from 2 systematic reviews and 19 addit
1c40: ional studies.<sup>1</sup> Most studies evaluated type III and t
1c80: ype IV portable monitors. The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 3 st
1cc0: udies (n=160) on type II portable monitors, 21 studies (n=1691) 
1d00: on type III portable monitors, and 84 studies (n=8773) on type I
1d40: V portable monitors.<sup>1</sup> None of the studies were conduc
1d80: ted in screen-detected populations, and most were conducted in r
1dc0: eferral populations being evaluated for suspected OSA. Studies w
1e00: ere conducted in a variety of settings (home or laboratory) and 
1e40: used a variety of AHI cutpoints, which were not always well repo
1e80: rted.<sup>1</sup> The overall quality of evidence on type II and
1ec0:  type IV portable monitors was found to be fair, while the overa
1f00: ll quality of evidence on type III portable monitors was found t
1f40: o be good. A broad range of sensitivity and specificity was repo
1f80: rted across multiple AHI cutpoints. Generally, studies on type I
1fc0: I and type III portable monitors reported moderate to high sensi
2000: tivity and specificity, whereas sensitivity and specificity of t
2040: ype IV portable monitors was highly variable and inconsistent (m
2080: ore information is available in Table 5 of the full evidence rep
20c0: ort<sup>1</sup>). Overall, consistent with findings from other s
2100: ystematic reviews, type III and type IV portable monitors seem t
2140: o be generally accurate in diagnosing OSA but have a wide and va
2180: riable bias in estimating actual AHI<sup>6,19</sup> in patients 
21c0: being evaluated for suspected OSA. It is unclear how these porta

2240: d persons.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and T
2280: reatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directl
22c0: y evaluated the effect of screening for OSA on health outcomes, 
2300: such as mortality, quality of life, and cardiovascular and cereb
2340: rovascular events. The USPSTF did identify and review studies on
2380:  the effect of treatment on intermediate outcomes (eg, AHI, ESS 
23c0: score, and blood pressure) and health outcomes (eg, mortality, q
2400: uality of life, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events).<
2440: /p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 76 good- to fair
2480: -quality treatment trials that described the effect of various i
24c0: nterventions on intermediate outcomes, including AHI, ESS score,
2500:  and blood pressure.<sup>1</sup> The most evidence was available
2540:  on CPAP and found that compared with sham intervention, CPAP re
2580: duced AHI (weighted mean difference [WMD], -33.8 [95% CI, -42.0 
25c0: to -25.6]; 13 studies; n=543), ESS score (WMD, -2.0 [95% CI, -2.
2600: 6 to -1.4]; 22 studies; n=2721), and blood pressure (diurnal sys
2640: tolic blood pressure WMD, -2.4 [95% CI, -3.9 to -0.9] and diurna
2680: l diastolic blood pressure WMD, -1.3 [95% CI, -2.2 to -0.4]; 15 
26c0: studies; n=1190).<sup>1</sup> Less evidence was available on the
2700:  effect of treatment with MADs on intermediate outcomes. Meta-an
2740: alysis found that compared with sham intervention, MADs reduced 
2780: AHI (WMD, -12.6 [95% CI, -15.5 to -9.7]; 6 studies; n=307) and E
27c0: SS score (WMD, -1.5 [95% CI, -2.8 to -0.2]; 5 studies; n=267) bu
2800: t not blood pressure. Five studies evaluated treatment with uppe
2840: r airway surgery; each evaluated a different surgical technique.
2880:  Findings on AHI were inconsistent, and no statistically signifi
28c0: cant improvements in ESS score or blood pressure were found. Alt
2900: hough studies generally showed that treatment with CPAP reduced 
2940: AHI to near-normal levels, treatment with MADs resulted in more 
2980: modest reductions, and the clinical significance of the small re
29c0: ductions in ESS score is uncertain. Small reductions in blood pr
2a00: essure are associated with cardiovascular disease benefits at th
2a40: e population level, but no evidence of this benefit was seen in 
2a80: these studies. Further, given that most of the trials were condu
2ac0: cted in referred or sleep clinic patients, the applicability of 
2b00: this evidence to a screen-detected population is limited.</p>\r\
2b40: n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 50 fair- to good-quali
2b80: ty trials that evaluated the effect of various treatments or int
2bc0: erventions on health outcomes.<sup>1</sup> The most evidence was
2c00:  available on CPAP; however, the USPSTF found the evidence on mo
2c40: st outcomes to be inadequate because of short length of follow-u
2c80: p and underpowered studies (ie, too few events observed). Thirty
2cc0: -one trials (n=2673) reported on the effect of treatment with CP
2d00: AP on mortality; most trials (29/31) followed up participants fo
2d40: r only 12 weeks or less, and most trials (27/31) reported no dea
2d80: ths in either study group.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Twelve trials report
2dc0: ed on cognitive function; however, they used heterogeneous outco
2e00: me measures, which made comparison difficult, and results were g
2e40: enerally inconsistent. Five trials (n=1529) reported on incidenc
2e80: e of myocardial infarction. Most trials (4/5) followed up partic
2ec0: ipants for less than 1 year, and when combined, only reported 1 
2f00: death (in the control group). Few trials reported on motor vehic
2f40: le crashes, cerebrovascular events, or heart failure.<sup>1</sup
2f80: > Evidence was available on general and sleep-related quality of
2fc0:  life, and there were small but statistically significant improv
3000: ements in sleep-related quality-of-life scores, but the clinical
3040:  significance of these improvements is unclear. Importantly, giv
3080: en the characteristics of included study participants (who were 
30c0: from sleep clinics or referral populations, were largely symptom
3100: atic, and had daytime sleepiness and more severe OSA), the appli
3140: cability of this evidence to an asymptomatic, screen-detected po

31c0: treatment with MADs (6 studies; n=510) or upper airway surgery (
3200: 4 studies; n=187) on any health outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite 
3240: the consistent observational findings of an association between 
3280: severe OSA and increased mortality, the USPSTF identified no stu
32c0: dies that reported on change in AHI and associated change in mor
3300: tality. Thus, it is unclear whether treatments that improve AHI 
3340: would also improve mortality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of 
3380: Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF identified no 
33c0: studies that directly evaluated the harms of screening for OSA. 
3400: A subset of studies that evaluated the effectiveness of various 
3440: OSA treatments also reported on harms of treatment. Nine studies
3480:  (n=1759) reported on harms of treatment with CPAP. Follow-up in
34c0:  these studies was generally from 8 to 12 weeks, and most partic
3500: ipants were men, with a mean age range of 42 to 61 years, who we
3540: re overweight or obese (mean BMI, 27 to 39 [calculated as weight
3580:  in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]). Overall, 2%
35c0:  to 47% of trial participants reported any adverse effects from 
3600: treatment with CPAP, including oral or nasal dryness, eye or ski
3640: n irritation, rash, epistaxis, and pain.<sup>1</sup> Eight trial
3680: s (n=443) reported on harms of treatment with MADs. Follow-up in
36c0:  these studies was generally from 4 to 6 weeks. In 7 trials, 17%
3700:  to 74% of participants reported oral mucosal, dental, or jaw sy
3740: mptoms, compared with 0% to 17% of participants in comparator gr

3880: (n=205) reported harms of treatment with upper airway surgery; 1

39c0: e of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, the USPSTF
3a00:  found insufficient evidence on screening for OSA in asymptomati

3a80: ly evaluated the benefits or harms of screening for OSA. Few stu
3ac0: dies evaluated the accuracy of specific screening tools to ident

3b80: f treatment with CPAP or MADs to improve intermediate outcomes (
3bc0: eg, AHI, ESS score, or blood pressure) in patients already recei

0000:  health care professional. The USPSTF discussed its definitional
0040:  approach extensively when creating the research plan. In the re
0080: search plan, the USPSTF established that persons without symptom
00c0: s or with unrecognized symptoms are the population of interest i
0100: n which to identify potentially unrecognized OSA. In response to
0140:  comments, the USPSTF described common symptoms of OSA and defin
0180: ed what is meant by persons with unrecognized symptoms. Other co
01c0: mments suggested that a number of key studies were omitted that 
0200: link OSA treatment to improved health outcomes. The USPSTF exami
0240: ned these studies and found they were either already included in
0280:  the review, did not meet eligibility criteria for inclusion in 
02c0: the review, or were otherwise outside the scope of the review. A
0300:  few comments suggested that persons who work in safety-sensitiv

0380: s) have unique testing needs. Clinicians seeking information on 
03c0: testing persons who work in these occupations can consult the ap

0f00:  and extensive clinical experience provide evidence of effective
0f40:  treatments for preeclampsia. Antihypertension medications, when

2c40:  to support breastfeeding may also involve a woman&#39;s partner
2c80: , other family members, and friends. This recommendation does no

2d00: eastfeeding (e.g., certain maternal medical conditions or infant
2d40:  metabolic disorders, such as galactosemia). The USPSTF did not 
2d80: review evidence on interventions directed at breastfeeding of pr
2dc0: eterm infants.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Interventions</strong></h3>\n\
2e00: n<p>Breastfeeding support can begin during pregnancy and continu
2e40: e through the early life of the child. Primary care clinicians c
2e80: an support women before and after childbirth by providing interv
2ec0: entions directly or through referral to help them make an inform
2f00: ed choice about how to feed their infants and to be successful i
2f40: n their choice. Interventions include promoting the benefits of 
2f80: breastfeeding, providing practical advice and direct support on 
2fc0: how to breastfeed, and providing psychological support. Interven
3000: tions can be categorized as professional support, peer support, 
3040: and formal education, although none of these categories are mutu
3080: ally exclusive, and interventions may be combined within and bet
30c0: ween categories.</p>\n\n<h4><em>Professional Support</em></h4>\n
3100: \n<p>Professional support is 1-on-1 counseling about breastfeedi
3140: ng provided by a health professional (medical, nursing, or allie
3180: d professionals, including those providing lactation care). Some
31c0:  interventions include the provision of supplies, such as educat
3200: ional materials, nursing bras, and breast pumps. Professional su
3240: pport can include providing information about the benefits of br
3280: eastfeeding, psychological support (encouraging the mother, prov
32c0: iding reassurance, and discussing the mother&rsquo;s questions a
3300: nd problems), and direct support during breastfeeding observatio
3340: ns (helping with the positioning of the infant and observing lat
3380: ching). Professional support may be delivered during pregnancy, 
33c0: the hospital stay, the postpartum period, or at multiple stages.
3400:  It may be conducted in an office setting, in the hospital, thro
3440: ugh home visits, through telephone support, or any combination o
3480: f these. Sessions generally last from 15 to 45 minutes, although
34c0:  some programs have used shorter or longer sessions. Most succes
3500: sful interventions include multiple sessions and are delivered a
3540: t more than 1 point in time.</p>\n\n<h4><em>Peer Support</em></h
3580: 4>\n\n<p>Similar to professional support, peer support provides 
35c0: women with 1-on-1 counseling about breastfeeding but is delivere
3600: d by a layperson (generally a mother with successful breastfeedi
3640: ng experience and a background similar to that of the patient) w
3680: ho has received training in how to provide support. Like profess
36c0: ional support, peer support may be delivered through a variety o
3700: f stages, settings, methods, and durations.</p>\n\n<h4><em>Forma
3740: l Education</em></h4>\n\n<p>Formal education interventions typic
3780: ally include a formalized program to convey general breastfeedin
37c0: g knowledge, most often in the prenatal period, although some ma
3800: y span time periods. Education is usually offered in group sessi
3840: ons and may include telephone support, electronic interventions,
3880:  videos, and print materials. They are directed at mothers but m
38c0: ay include other family members. Content generally focuses on th
3900: e benefits of breastfeeding, practical breastfeeding skills (e.g
3940: ., latching), and the management of common breastfeeding complic
3980: ations; these programs may also offer family members encourageme
39c0: nt and advice on how to support the mother.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>U

3b80: /strong></h3>\n\n<p>Although there is moderate certainty that br

3d00: n addition to clinicians&rsquo; direct activities to support bre

1600: , respectively.<sup>8</sup></p>\n\n<h3><strong>Scope of Review</
1640: strong></h3>\n\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence
1680:  review to update its 2008 recommendation on primary care interv
16c0: entions to promote breastfeeding.<sup>5,7</sup> This update focu
1700: sed on the effectiveness of interventions to support breastfeedi
1740: ng on breastfeeding initiation, duration, and exclusivity. The U
1780: SPSTF briefly reviewed the literature on the effects of breastfe

1800: previous review to ensure that there have been no major changes

19c0: e clinicians.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Effectiveness of Interventions 
1a00: to Change Behavior and Outcomes</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The USPSTF f
1a40: ound insufficient evidence to determine the direct effects of in
1a80: terventions to support breastfeeding on child and maternal healt
1ac0: h outcomes. Six trials reported inconsistent effects of counseli
1b00: ng interventions on a range of infant health outcomes, including
1b40:  gastrointestinal illness, otitis media, respiratory tract illne
1b80: ss, and health care use. None of the studies reported maternal h
1bc0: ealth outcomes.<sup>5,9-14</sup></p>\n\n<p>However, the USPSTF f
1c00: ound evidence that interventions to support breastfeeding can in
1c40: crease the rate and duration of breastfeeding. An analysis of 43
1c80:  trials found that breastfeeding support and education intervent
1cc0: ions targeting women were associated with a higher likelihood of
1d00:  any and exclusive breastfeeding at less than 3 months and at 3 
1d40: to 6 months compared with usual care. Pooled estimates indicate 
1d80: a beneficial association for any breastfeeding at less than 3 mo
1dc0: nths (risk ratio [RR], 1.07 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.11]; 26 studies) 
1e00: and at 3 to 6 months (RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.04 to 1.18]; 23 studie
1e40: s) and for exclusive breastfeeding at less than 3 months (RR, 1.
1e80: 21 [95% CI, 1.11 to 1.33]; 22 studies) and at 3 to 6 months (RR,
1ec0:  1.20 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.38]; 18 studies). At 6 months, individu
1f00: al-level interventions among women were associated with a 16% hi
1f40: gher likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding (RR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.
1f80: 02 to 1.32]; 17 studies) but not any breastfeeding. The associat

2000: tiation was not significant, based on the pooled point estimate 
2040: (RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.02]; 14 studies).<sup>5</sup> Based
2080:  on these data, it can be projected that for every 30 women offe

2140:  design, there was little evidence that the effects of individua
2180: l-level interventions vary across different populations or inter
21c0: vention characteristics, although the variability may have maske
2200: d such relationships. There was some suggestion that interventio
2240: ns taking place during a combination of prenatal, peripartum, or
2280:  postpartum time periods were more effective than those taking p
22c0: lace only during 1 time period. Some data also suggested that in
2300: terventions are effective in both adolescents and adults. All 4 
2340: trials of individual-level interventions among adolescents or yo

2400: tial Harms of Interventions to Support Breastfeeding</strong></h
2440: 3>\n\n<p>There are very few data on the potential harms of inter
2480: ventions to support breastfeeding, which in theory could include
24c0:  guilt related to not breastfeeding, increased anxiety about bre
2500: astfeeding, and increased postpartum depression. Only 2 trials a
2540: mong adults reported on adverse events related to a breastfeedin
2580: g support intervention. One trial found no significant differenc
25c0: es in maternal anxiety between groups at 2 weeks. The other tria
2600: l reported that a few mothers expressed feelings of anxiety and 
2640: decreased confidence in their breastfeeding ability despite brea
2680: stfeeding going well and discontinued their participation in the
26c0:  peer counseling intervention.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Estimate of Ma
2700: gnitude of Net Benefit</strong></h3>\n\n<p>There is adequate evi
2740: dence that interventions to support breastfeeding change behavio
2780: r and that the harms of these interventions are no greater than 
27c0: small. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty t

28c0: osted for public comment on the USPSTF website from April 26 to 
2900: May 23, 2016. Many comments expressed concern that the recommend
2940: ation did not explicitly include the term &quot;promotion&quot;

3d80: pecific risk factors, including parental obesity, poor nutrition
3dc0: , low levels of physical activity, inadequate sleep, sedentary b

3e40: factors associated with obesity in younger children include mate
3e80: rnal diabetes, maternal smoking, gestational weight gain, and ra
3ec0: pid infant growth. A decrease in physical activity in young chil
3f00: dren is a risk factor for obesity later in adolescence. Obesity 
3f40: rates continue to increase in some racial/ethnic minority popula
3f80: tions. These racial/ethnic differences in obesity prevalence are

0340: r\n<h3>Screening Interval</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no evi
0380: dence regarding appropriate screening intervals for obesity in c
03c0: hildren and adolescents. Height and weight, which are necessary 
0400: for BMI calculation, are routinely measured during health mainte

0480: \n\r\n<p>The USPSTF recognizes the challenges that children and 
04c0: their families encounter in having limited access to effective, 
0500: intensive behavioral interventions for obesity. Identifying obes
0540: ity in children and how to address it are important steps in hel
0580: ping children and families obtain the support they need.</p>\r\n
05c0: \r\n<p>The USPSTF found that comprehensive, intensive behavioral
0600:  interventions with a total of 26 contact hours or more over a p
0640: eriod of 2 to 12 months resulted in weight loss (<a href=\"#tabl
0680: e1\">Table 1</a>).<sup>3,4</sup> Behavioral interventions with a
06c0:  total of 52 contact hours or more demonstrated greater weight l
0700: oss and some improvements in cardiovascular and metabolic risk f
0740: actors. These effective, higher-intensity (&ge;26 contact hours)
0780:  behavioral interventions consisted of multiple components.<sup>
07c0: 3,4</sup> Although these components varied across interventions,
0800:  they frequently included sessions targeting both the parent and
0840:  child (separately, together, or both); offered individual sessi
0880: ons (both family and group); provided information about healthy 
08c0: eating, safe exercising, and reading food labels; encouraged the
0900:  use of stimulus control (e.g., limiting access to tempting food
0940: s and limiting screen time), goal setting, self-monitoring, cont
0980: ingent rewards, and problem solving; and included supervised phy
09c0: sical activity sessions. Intensive interventions involving 52 or
0a00:  more contact hours rarely took place in primary care settings b
0a40: ut rather in settings to which primary care clinicians could ref
0a80: er patients. These types of interventions were often delivered b
0ac0: y multidisciplinary teams, including pediatricians, exercise phy
0b00: siologists or physical therapists, dieticians or diet assistants
0b40: , psychologists or social workers, or other behavioral specialis
0b80: ts.<sup>3,4</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adherence to interventions can c
0bc0: hange their effectiveness. In the included trials, 68% to 95% of
0c00:  participants completed all of the sessions.<sup>3</sup> Lower a
0c40: dherence in clinical practice could decrease the overall benefit
0c80:  of these interventions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Metformin has been used f
0cc0: or weight loss in children but is not approved by the US Food an
0d00: d Drug Administration for this purpose. Metformin has a small ef
0d40: fect on weight (BMI reduction &lt;1), and this effect is of unce
0d80: rtain clinical significance. Although the harms of metformin use
0dc0:  are probably small, evidence regarding long-term outcomes of it
0e00: s use is lacking. In addition, participants in the metformin tri
0e40: als had abnormal insulin or glucose metabolism, and most had sev
0e80: ere obesity. This limits the applicability of the results to a g
0ec0: eneral pediatric population with obesity. Orlistat is approved b
0f00: y the US Food and Drug Administration for use in adolescents 12 
0f40: years and older. However, orlistat also has a small effect on we
0f80: ight (BMI reduction &lt;1), and this effect is of uncertain clin
0fc0: ical significance. In addition, orlistat is associated with mode
1000: rate harms. Therefore, the USPSTF encourages clinicians to promo
1040: te behavioral interventions as the primary effective interventio
1080: n for weight loss in children and adolescents.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><e
10c0: m>Clinically Important Weight Loss</em></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Research 
1100: studies use a standardized measure (<em>z</em> score) of BMI kno
1140: wn as BMI <em>z</em> score. This measure helps compare results a
1180: mong children of different ages and over time as children grow. 
11c0: A few observational studies have addressed the question of what 
1200: change in BMI <em>z</em> score or excess weight represents a cli
1240: nically important change. These studies showed that a BMI <em>z<
1280: /em> score reduction of 0.15 to 0.25 is associated with improvem
12c0: ents in cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors.<sup>3,4</sup>
1300:  A German expert panel determined that a BMI <em>z</em> score re
1340: duction of 0.20 is clinically significant and is comparable to a
1380:  weight loss of approximately 5%.<sup>11</sup> A BMI <em>z</em> 
13c0: score reduction in the range of 0.20 to 0.25 appears to be a sui
1400: table threshold for clinically important change.<sup>3</sup></p>
1440: \r\n\r\n<p>An analysis by Epstein et al of 10-year outcomes from
1480:  4 randomized clinical trials of family-based behavioral obesity
14c0:  treatment programs suggested an association between weight loss
1500:  in childhood and decreased risk of obesity in early adulthood. 
1540: Participants were aged 8 to 12 years at baseline (mean age, 10.4
1580:  years), and average age at follow-up was 20 years.<sup>3,12,13<
15c0: /sup> Almost all participants (about 85%) had obesity at baselin

1640: e contact hours with the families. Among children with obesity, 
1680: 52% continued to have obesity as adults.<sup>3,12,13</sup> In co
16c0: ntrast, naturalistic longitudinal studies with similar follow-up
1700:  report obesity rates of 64% to 87% among adults who had obesity

1c80: tions</h2><h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF 
1cc0: identified several areas in need of further research. Trials eva
1d00: luating the direct benefit and harms of screening for obesity in

1d80: ment a systematic screening and treatment program in 1 set of cl

1e00: et of clinics and providers. Reproducing existing effective inte
1e40: rventions and conducting full trials of small feasibility studie
1e80: s are necessary next steps. Further investigations to determine 
1ec0: the specific effective components of behavioral interventions ar
1f00: e needed. Long-term follow-up of participants after completion o
1f40: f treatment is needed to confirm maintenance of weight loss and 
1f80: to assess long-term benefits and harms. More studies are needed 
1fc0: that address behavioral interventions in diverse populations and
2000:  younger children (age &le;5 years). Also, more evidence is need
2040: ed about what constitutes clinically important health benefits a
2080: nd the amount of weight loss associated with those health benefi

2b40: The USPSTF previously found adequate evidence that BMI is an acc

2c00: ve, intensive behavioral interventions in children and adolescen

2c80:  in weight status for up to 12 months. It found inadequate evide
2cc0: nce regarding the effectiveness of less intensive interventions.
2d00:  The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of behavi
2d40: oral interventions as small to none and judged the harms of scre
2d80: ening to be minimal. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with modera
2dc0: te certainty that screening for obesity in children and adolesce
2e00: nts 6 years and older is of moderate net benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3
2e40: >How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n\r
2e80: \n<p>Genetics and various environmental factors play important r
2ec0: oles in the development of obesity. Once obesity has developed, 
2f00: an individual&rsquo;s biochemical feedback mechanisms work to su
2f40: stain the body&rsquo;s weight gain.<sup>23</sup> Changes in neur
2f80: onal signaling decrease satiety and perceptions of the amount of
2fc0:  food eaten.<sup>24</sup> As a result, weight loss can be challe
3000: nging. Prospective data suggest that cardiovascular risk factors
3040:  among adults without obesity are similar between those who had 
3080: obesity as children and those who did not.<sup>3,25</sup> This s
30c0: uggests that adverse cardiovascular effects in childhood may be

3a00: f improvement in intermediate outcomes results in improvement in

0d40: imates of the prevalence of iron deficiency in children ages 1 t
0d80: o 3 years in the United States range from 8% to 14%, and approxi
0dc0: mately one third of these children also have anemia.<sup>3</sup>
0e00:  Based on 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination
0e40:  Survey (NHANES) data, the estimated prevalence of iron deficien
0e80: cy anemia in children ages 12 to 35 months is 2.1%.<sup>1</sup> 
0ec0: Several factors have been identified that may increase a child&r
0f00: squo;s risk for iron deficiency anemia, including prematurity or
0f40:  low birth weight, use of non&ndash;iron-fortified formula or in
0f80: troduction to cow&#39;s milk in the first year of life, and excl
0fc0: usive breastfeeding without regular intake of iron-fortified foo
1000: d after age 6 months. Demographic factors associated with increa
1040: sed risk for iron deficiency anemia include low socioeconomic st
1080: atus and having parents who are migrant workers or recent immigr
10c0: ants. Additional factors that may be associated with increased r
1100: isk for iron deficiency in children include weight and height in
1140:  the 95th percentile or greater, bottle feeding beyond the first
1180:  year of life, having a mother who is currently pregnant, or liv
11c0: ing in an urban area. Evidence on whether Hispanic ethnicity inc
1200: reases children&#39;s risk for iron deficiency has been mixed, w
1240: ith some studies showing an increased risk and others showing no
1280:  increased risk. Older data from NHANES (1988&ndash;1994) showed
12c0:  that Mexican American children were nearly 3 times more likely 
1300: than white children to have iron deficiency, whereas more recent
1340:  NHANES data from 1999&ndash;2002 found no increased risk in His
1380: panic children.<sup>3</sup> The USPSTF found no studies that ass
13c0: essed the performance of risk assessment tools to identify child
1400: ren who are at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia.</p>\r\
1440: n\r\n<p>Some observational studies suggest that iron deficiency 
1480: anemia in early childhood may be associated with neurodevelopmen
14c0: tal and behavioral delays and poorer performance on cognitive te
1500: sts. However, concluding that there is a direct causal link betw
1540: een iron deficiency anemia and these outcomes is difficult becau
1580: se of the methodological flaws in these studies and potential co
15c0: nfounding due to underlying nutritional and socioeconomic differ
1600: ences between groups.<sup>3</sup> The aim of screening for iron 
1640: deficiency anemia in young children is to identify and treat ane
1680: mia before it leads to poor child health outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h
16c0: 4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The harms of screening for iron
1700:  deficiency anemia have not been well studied. Potential harms o
1740: f screening include false-positive results, anxiety, and cost. R
1780: eported adverse events of treatment with iron include limited ga
17c0: strointestinal symptoms, darkening color of stool, staining of t
1800: eeth and gums, and drug interactions with other medications. The
1840:  previous USPSTF recommendation also noted that accidental iron 
1880: overdose can occur in children receiving treatment or supplement
18c0: ation with iron.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>
1900: No recent nationally representative data on the current rate of 
1940: screening are available.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n
1980: \r\n<p>Although the evidence is insufficient to recommend specif
19c0: ic tests for screening, measurement of serum hemoglobin or hemat
1a00: ocrit is often the first step.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Treatment and Inte
1a40: rventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the United States, iron deficiency a
1a80: nemia in children is usually treated with oral iron. The usual d
1ac0: ose in infants and young children is 3 to 6 mg/kg of elemental i
1b00: ron per day in 2 to 3 divided doses.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>
1b40: Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the I
1b80: nstitute of Medicine, the Recommended Dietary Allowance for iron
1bc0:  in infants ages 7 to 12 months is 11 mg per day. In children ag
1c00: es 1 to 3 years, the Recommended Dietary Allowance is 7 mg per d
1c40: ay. Natural food sources of iron include certain fruits, vegetab
1c80: les, meat, and poultry. The Institute of Medicine also notes tha
1cc0: t nonheme iron, which is found in vegetarian diets, may be less 
1d00: well absorbed than heme iron, which is found in diets containing
1d40:  meat; therefore, the iron requirement may be almost twice as mu
1d80: ch in children who eat a purely vegetarian diet.<sup>4</sup> For
1dc0: tified breads and grain products (such as cereal) are also good 
1e00: sources of iron for young children eating solid foods.<sup>5</su
1e40: p> Iron-fortified formula is another source of iron for infants.
1e80:  Federally regulated iron fortification of food products in the 
1ec0: United States began in 1941, and the iron content in enriched gr
1f00: ain products has increased over the years.<sup>6</sup> More than
1f40:  50% of the iron in the U.S. food supply comes from iron-fortifi

3480:        <p>The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the evi
34c0: dence to update its 2006 recommendation on screening for iron de
3500: ficiency anemia. The current review assessed the evidence on you
3540: ng children ages 6 to 24 months. The USPSTF focused on reviewing
3580:  the evidence on the association between change in iron status a
35c0: s a result of intervention and improvement in child health outco
3600: mes, as well as treatment of iron deficiency anemia with oral ir
3640: on formulations. The USPSTF considered studies conducted in sett
3680: ings similar to the United States in rates of  malnutrition, hem
36c0: oparasite burden, and general socioeconomic status. The focus of
3700:  the current recommendation is on screening and prevention of ir
3740: on deficiency anemia; however, findings on iron deficiency, as r
3780: eported by individual studies,  also are provided for a better u
37c0: nderstanding of the potential burden in the U.S. population.</p>
3800: \r\n             \r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\
3840: n<p>Serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is the primary screening test
3880:  for iron deficiency anemia. Hemoglobin is sensitive for  detect
38c0: ing iron deficiency anemia; however, it is not sensitive for det
3900: ecting iron deficiency because mild deficiency states may not af
3940: fect hemoglobin levels.<sup>3</sup> Hemoglobin is also nonspecif
3980: ic, as approximately 60% of cases of anemia result from causes o
39c0: ther than iron deficiency.<sup>1</sup> The positive predictive v
3a00: alue of low hemoglobin for iron deficiency in children age 12 mo
3a40: nths ranges from 10% to 40%.<sup>10</sup> In infants, particular
3a80: ly before age 12 months, iron deficiency and iron deficiency ane
3ac0: mia often resolve spontaneously, reducing the positive predictiv
3b00: e value of any screening test. The sensitivity and specificity o
3b40: f other single tests (e.g., serum ferritin, transferrin saturati
3b80: on, and erythrocyte protoporphyrin) as primary screening tools f
3bc0: or iron deficiency anemia have not been well studied.<sup>11</su
3c00: p> Serum ferritin, often  used to measure iron status, acts as a
3c40: n acute-phase reactant, so it should ideally be measured in the 
3c80: absence of infection or inflammation.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3
3cc0: > Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>
3d00: No studies directly evaluated the effectiveness of screening for
3d40:  iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic children  ages 6 to 24 m
3d80: onths and reported on health outcomes. In addition, no new studi

3e80: y were found to be of poor quality or were conducted in settings
3ec0:  not applicable to the current U.S. population. In 2006, the USP
3f00: STF concluded that there was poor evidence (conflicting studies)
3f40:  of the effectiveness of interventions that demonstrate improved

0240:  harms of treatment but noted that accidental iron overdose can 
0280: occur in children receiving treatment or supplementation with ir
02c0: on. One older trial from 1991 that was not included in the previ

0380: r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n            
03c0: <p>Overall, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening 
0400: for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic children ages 6 to 24
0440:  months. The USPSTF identified no studies that evaluated the ben
0480: efits or harms of screening in this age group. Studies on the be
04c0: nefits and harms of treatment were generally older, conducted in
0500:  settings not considered applicable to the current U.S. populati
0540: on, or of poor quality. The USPSTF did not find  sufficient evid

07c0: scribing risk factors for iron deficiency anemia and the target 
0800: population for this recommendation was inserted earlier in the s

0880: quested separate analyses of certain high-risk populations. Alth
08c0: ough the USPSTF sought this information, limitations in the  evi

09c0:  used. The recommendation was reviewed to ensure  consistent use

2e40: iously commissioned a separate evidence review focused on screen

2ec0: on that review, the USPSTF recommended offering or referring adu
2f00: lts with obesity to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interve
2f40: ntions (B recommendation).<sup>9</sup> To highlight this benefit
2f80: , the USPSTF decided to exclude persons with obesity from the cu

1000: PSTF considered 34 trials, involving more than 75,000 persons, t
1040: hat reported on intermediate outcomes such as blood pressure lev
1080: el, LDL-C level, and BMI.<sup>3</sup> Most of the interventions

15c0: The USPSTF reviewed 86 trials, involving more than 115,000 perso
1600: ns, that reported on behavioral outcomes such as fruit and veget
1640: able consumption, salt intake, and minutes per week of physical 
1680: activity.<sup>3</sup> Almost all trials used self-reported measu
16c0: res for behavioral outcomes. Although substantial statistical he
1700: terogeneity prevented pooled analysis, in general, healthful die
1740: t interventions were associated with reduced saturated fat, sodi
1780: um, and total caloric energy intake and increased fruit and vege
17c0: table and fiber intake. Physical activity interventions resulted
1800:  in an increase of approximately 35 minutes of physical activity
1840:  per week and 32% higher odds of meeting recommended physical ac
1880: tivity guidelines.<sup>3</sup> Studies that limited enrollment t
18c0: o persons who did not meet physical activity guidelines at basel
1900: ine had greater increases in physical activity levels compared w
1940: ith studies that included persons who were already active at bas
1980: eline.<sup>3</sup></p>\n\n<p>Among the 32 trials reporting both 
19c0: intermediate and behavioral outcomes, concordant changes were ge
1a00: nerally seen in behavioral outcomes when positive findings were 
1a40: seen in intermediate outcomes.<sup>3</sup> For example, trials t
1a80: hat found significant improvements in blood pressure levels gene
1ac0: rally also found significant reductions in measures of sodium in
1b00: take. Studies that found reductions in waist circumference also 
1b40: reported increased physical activity levels. Several studies dem
1b80: onstrated improvements in behavioral outcomes but did not find c
1bc0: oncordant improvements in intermediate outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>The U
1c00: SPSTF found 4 trials that reported on measures of sedentary beha
1c40: vior.<sup>3</sup> Although there were some small but significant
1c80:  effects, the results were not consistent.</p>\n\n<h3>Potential 
1cc0: Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>\n\n<p>Of the 8
1d00: 8 trials reviewed by the USPSTF, 14 specifically reported on adv
1d40: erse events.<sup>3</sup> No trials reported any serious adverse 
1d80: events related to the counseling intervention. Eight trials repo
1dc0: rted on the incidence of important patient events, including fal
1e00: ls, injuries, and cardiovascular events. Seven trials found no d
1e40: ifference between intervention and control groups. One trial in 
1e80: women aged 40 to 74 years reported more injuries among intervent
1ec0: ion participants over 24 months of follow-up (19% vs 14%; <em>P<
1f00: /em> = 0.03). This trial also reported more falls in the interve
1f40: ntion group (37% vs 29%; <em>P</em> &lt; 0.001).<sup>21</sup> Fo
1f80: ur other trials reporting falls, 2 in older adults and 2 in gene
1fc0: ral primary care populations, found no difference between interv
2000: ention and control groups over 12 months of follow-up.</p>\n\n<h
2040: 3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\n\n<p>The USPSTF ass
2080: essed the overall effectiveness of behavioral counseling interve
20c0: ntions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity to be p
2100: ositive but small. Counseling interventions result in improvemen
2140: ts in healthful behaviors and small but potentially important im
2180: provements in intermediate outcomes, including reductions in blo
21c0: od pressure and LDL-C levels and improvements in measures of adi
2200: posity. Noting the concordance between behavioral and intermedia
2240: te outcomes and the apparent dose-response effect of behavioral 
2280: interventions on intermediate and behavioral outcomes, the USPST
22c0: F concluded that the evidence is adequate to establish the benef
2300: its of behavioral counseling interventions. The USPSTF concluded
2340:  that the overall magnitude of benefit related to these interven
2380: tions for persons without obesity who do not have hypertension, 
23c0: dyslipidemia, abnormal blood glucose levels, or diabetes is posi
2400: tive but small. The potential harms are at most small, leading t
2440: he USPSTF to conclude that these interventions have a small net 
2480: benefit for this population.</p>\n\n<h3>Response to Public Comme
24c0: nt</h3>\n\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement w
2500: as posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from November
2540:  29, 2016, to January 2, 2017. A small number of comments were r
2580: eceived, and all were reviewed by the USPSTF. A few respondents 
25c0: encouraged the USPSTF to issue separate recommendations for beha
2600: vioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and 
2640: interventions to promote physical activity. Other respondents fe
2680: lt that the evidence base was different for the 2 types of behav
26c0: ioral counseling interventions and suggested that the USPSTF ass
2700: ign separate and different grades. The USPSTF carefully reviewed
2740:  the evidence on interventions that promoted a healthful diet on
2780: ly, those that promoted physical activity only, and those that p
27c0: romoted both. The USPSTF recognizes that the evidence base for t
2800: hese interventions varies, and although the evidence for behavio
2840: r change was greater for interventions focusing on physical acti
2880: vity, there were no meaningful differences in intermediate or ov
28c0: erall health outcomes. After reviewing the evidence, the USPSTF 
2900: reaffirmed its conclusion that there is a positive but small ben
2940: efit of behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthf
2980: ul diet, physical activity, or both in persons who do not have C
29c0: VD risk factors. Patients and health care professionals can deci
2a00: de together, based on patient interest and the availability of l
2a40: ocal resources, whether a focus on a healthful diet, physical ac
2a80: tivity, or both is most appropriate. Several comments agreed wit
2ac0: h the USPSTF&#39;s inclusion of language reinforcing the establi
2b00: shed benefits of healthful lifestyle behaviors and encouraged be
2b40: tter definition of the nature of behavioral counseling intervent
2b80: ions. The USPSTF retained its emphasis that all patients can gai
2bc0: n health benefits from a healthful diet and appropriate physical
2c00:  activity and added language defining both. The USPSTF also clar
2c40: ified that the recommended behavioral counseling interventions a
2c80: re more intensive than just general promotion of a healthful die
2cc0: t and physical activity.</p>\n","topic":"Healthful Diet and Phys

2ec0: "<h2>Rationale</h2><h3>Importance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The age-adjuste
2f00: d incidence of ovarian cancer from 2010 to 2014 was 11.4 cases p
2f40: er 100,000 women per year.<sup>1</sup> Ovarian cancer is the fif
2f80: th most common cause of cancer death among US women and the lead
2fc0: ing cause of death from gynecologic cancer, despite its low inci
3000: dence.<sup>1</sup> Approximately 14,000 women die of ovarian can
3040: cer each year in the United States. More than 95% of ovarian can
3080: cer deaths occur among women 45 years and older.<sup>2</sup></p>
30c0: \r\n\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The positive predictive val
3100: ue of screening tests for ovarian cancer is low, and most women 
3140: with a positive screening test result do not have ovarian cancer
3180:  (ie, many women without ovarian cancer will have a false-positi
31c0: ve result on screening tests).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Benefits of Screen
3200: ing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that scree
3240: ning with transvaginal ultrasound, testing for the serum tumor m
3280: arker cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), or a combination of both does
32c0:  not reduce ovarian cancer mortality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Harms of Sc
3300: reening</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that s
3340: creening for ovarian cancer can result in important harms, inclu
3380: ding many false-positive results, which can lead to unnecessary 
33c0: surgical interventions in women who do not have cancer. Dependin
3400: g on the type of screening test used, the magnitude of harm rang
3440: es from moderate to substantial and reflects the risk for unnece
3480: ssary diagnostic surgery. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence o
34c0: n the psychological harms of screening for ovarian cancer.</p>\r
3500: \n\r\n<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF concludes 
3540: that there is at least moderate certainty that the harms of scre
3580: ening for ovarian cancer outweigh the benefits.</p>","clinical":
35c0: "<h2>Clinical Considerations</h2><h3>Patient Population Under Co
3600: nsideration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This recommendation applies to asympt
3640: omatic women who are not known to have a high-risk hereditary ca
3680: ncer syndrome. A hereditary cancer syndrome occurs when a geneti
36c0: c mutation is passed from parent to child that increases risk fo
3700: r developing cancers or can cause earlier onset of cancers. Wome
3740: n who have a hereditary cancer syndrome that puts them at high r
3780: isk for ovarian cancer are excluded from this recommendation.</p
37c0: >\r\n\r\n<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Women with certain h
3800: ereditary cancer syndromes are at high risk for ovarian cancer. 
3840: For example, women with <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> genetic
3880:  mutations associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer 
38c0: are at high risk for ovarian cancer. Numerous genetic mutations 
3900: and hereditary cancer syndromes may be associated with ovarian c
3940: ancer, each with a different constellation of associated cancers
3980:  and family history pattern.<sup>3-5</sup> Women with a family h
39c0: istory of ovarian or breast cancer may be at risk for a heredita
3a00: ry cancer syndrome and should discuss their family history with 
3a40: their health care professional. Management of a diagnosed heredi
3a80: tary cancer syndrome and prevention of ovarian cancer in these w
3ac0: omen is beyond the scope of this recommendation statement.</p>\r
3b00: \n\r\n<p>The clinical symptoms of ovarian cancer (eg, abdominal 
3b40: pain or pressure, bloating, constipation, urinary symptoms, back
3b80:  pain, or fatigue) are nonspecific and may be present in both he
3bc0: althy women and women with late-stage ovarian cancer; therefore,
3c00:  use of clinical symptoms for risk stratification for the early 
3c40: detection of disease is difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Screening Test
3c80: s</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF does not recommend routine screening
3cc0:  for ovarian cancer using any method. Transvaginal ultrasound an
3d00: d serum CA-125 testing are readily available procedures that are
3d40:  commonly used to evaluate women with signs or symptoms of ovari
3d80: an cancer, and both have been evaluated in screening studies. Pe
3dc0: lvic examination is also commonly performed to evaluate women wi
3e00: th lower abdominal symptoms, and although many clinicians percei
3e40: ve that pelvic examination with bimanual palpation of the ovarie
3e80: s is useful for screening for ovarian cancer,<sup>6</sup> there 
3ec0: is a lack of evidence to support this.<sup>7</sup> Furthermore, 
3f00: the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screen
3f40: ing Trial included bimanual palpation of the ovaries in its init
3f80: ial screening protocol, but this screening component was discont

0040: ries.<sup>8, 9</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The evaluation of abnormal te
0080: st results consists of repeat testing with the same or a differe
00c0: nt test and often surgical removal (by laparoscopy or laparotomy
0100: ) of 1 or both of the ovaries and fallopian tubes to determine w
0140: hether a woman has ovarian cancer. Diagnostic guidelines recomme

0340: ily history indicating they are at risk for a deleterious gene m
0380: utation (<em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em>) be referred for genet
03c0: ic counseling and, if indicated, genetic testing.<sup>10</sup> T

05c0: esearch Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that most cases of o
0600: varian cancer are diagnosed at later stages, when associated mor
0640: tality is high, further research is needed to identify new scree
0680: ning strategies that could accurately detect ovarian cancer earl
06c0: y, at a point when outcomes could be improved. There is a need f
0700: or more sensitive and specific serologic tests, as well as bette
0740: r imaging techniques. Because of the potential for serious harms
0780:  from diagnostic workup of positive screening results (ie, surgi
07c0: cal removal of the ovary to determine whether ovarian cancer is 
0800: present), new screening strategies should minimize false-positiv
0840: e results and be highly specific. In addition, studies evaluatin
0880: g the benefits and harms of these screening strategies in asympt
08c0: omatic women not at high risk for ovarian cancer are needed. Stu
0900: dy outcomes should include ovarian cancer mortality, quality of 
0940: life, false-positive rate, surgery rate, surgical complication r

09c0:  primary prevention of ovarian cancer.</p><h2>Update of Previous

1700: w</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidenc
1740: e on screening for ovarian cancer to update its 2012 recommendat
1780: ion. The evidence review evaluated the benefits and harms of scr
17c0: eening for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women not known to be 
1800: at high risk for ovarian cancer. Outcomes of interest included o
1840: varian cancer mortality, quality of life, false-positive rate, s

1940: t the primary end point of the study, because clinically, both t
1980: ypes of cancer are diagnosed and treated as 1 disease. The USPST
19c0: F also considered ascertainment of ovarian cancer outcomes that 
1a00: included both incident and prevalent cases of cancer, since scre
1a40: ening programs would detect both. The review included any screen
1a80: ing approach evaluated by clinical trial design. The USPSTF cons
1ac0: idered the initial screening test (eg, transvaginal ultrasound o
1b00: r CA-125 testing interpreted using a single cutoff or the risk o
1b40: f ovarian cancer algorithm [ROCA; Abcodia Inc]) as the screening
1b80:  intervention. Further testing that subsequently occurred based

1c00: ng and evaluation, rather than part of screening.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3
1c40: >Effectiveness of Screening</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed d
1c80: irect evidence evaluating the benefits of screening for ovarian 
1cc0: cancer on mortality.<sup>3</sup> The USPSTF identified 3 good-qu
1d00: ality studies evaluating the effect of annual screening in asymp
1d40: tomatic women not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer. N
1d80: one of the studies found that screening significantly reduced ov
1dc0: arian cancer mortality. The largest and most recent trial, the U
1e00: K Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS), was
1e40:  a randomized clinical trial of 202,638 postmenopausal women age
1e80: d 50 to 74 years not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer
1ec0: .<sup>15</sup> More than 95% of trial participants were white, a
1f00: nd 1.6% reported a maternal history of ovarian cancer and 6.4% r
1f40: eported a maternal history of breast cancer; however, women with
1f80:  a family history considered &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; for familia
1fc0: l ovarian cancer were explicitly excluded.<sup>16</sup> The UKCT
2000: OCS trial had 2 intervention groups and a no-screening control g
2040: roup. Women were randomized to screening with CA-125 serum testi
2080: ng, with triage and follow-up determined by ROCA, or to yearly t
20c0: ransvaginal ultrasound. The CA-125 ROCA screening intervention g
2100: roup was described as multimodal screening in the trial publicat
2140: ions and included a standard protocol for all additional evaluat
2180: ion. ROCA evaluates changes in CA-125 values over time, followin
21c0: g a baseline age-adjusted measurement. Women randomized to the c
2200: ontrol group received no screening. After a median follow-up of 
2240: 11.1 years, ovarian cancer mortality (which includes mortality f
2280: rom primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancer) was not signif
22c0: icantly different among the control group and 2 intervention gro
2300: upss (0.35% in the control group, 0.32% in the transvaginal ultr

2500:  this finding was not statistically significant unless cases of 
2540: primary peritoneal cancer were excluded. Extended follow-up data
2580:  may help clarify this potential finding in the future; however,
25c0:  given the aggressive nature (ie, low 5-year survival rate) of o
2600: varian cancer, the mechanism behind a delayed benefit from scree
2640: ning and early detection would be unclear, especially because th
2680: e trial discontinued screening after 7 to 11 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<
26c0: p>The pilot trial for the UKCTOCS trial, UK Pilot, was much smal
2700: ler (n = 21,955 randomized). It evaluated the use of a single cu
2740: toff value for CA-125 testing and found no significant differenc
2780: e in ovarian cancer mortality (excluding cases of primary perito
27c0: neal cancer, which were not reported) between women who were scr
2800: eened vs not screened (0.08% vs 0.16%; relative risk, 0.5 [95% C

29c0: 2.4 years. Eligible participants were women aged 55 to 74 years 
2a00: without a previous diagnosis of lung, colorectal, or ovarian can
2a40: cer. Trial recruitment targeted women from the general populatio
2a80: n; the trial did not actively exclude women based on risk for he
2ac0: reditary ovarian cancer syndromes (based on reported family hist
2b00: ory), and 17.4% of participants reported a family history of ova
2b40: rian or breast cancer. Nearly 90% of participants were white. Ab
2b80: normal test results were managed by the participant&#39;s person
2bc0: al health care practitioner. No difference was found in ovarian 
2c00: cancer mortality, which includes primary peritoneal cancer morta

2d80: Potential Harms of Screening</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed

2e40: reporting on quality of life and psychological harms of screenin
2e80: g (Quality of life, Education, and Screening Trial [QUEST]) (n =

2f00: he calculated false-positive rates (ie, the number of women with

2f80: in the first screening round in the UKCTOCS transvaginal ultraso
2fc0: und group and 9.0% in the first screening round in the UKCTOCS C
3000: A-125 ROCA group.<sup>3</sup> These rates exclude cases of prima
3040: ry peritoneal cancer because this information was not reported. 
3080: Cumulatively, in all subsequent screening rounds (ie, rounds 2 t
30c0: o 11) in the UKCTOCS CA-125 ROCA group, 44.2% of women who did n
3100: ot have ovarian cancer (including primary peritoneal cancer) had
3140:  a positive CA-125 ROCA result at some point during the trial sc
3180: reening period.<sup>3</sup> The false-positive rate for subseque
31c0: nt screening rounds in the UKCTOCS transvaginal ultrasound group
3200:  was not reported. In the UK Pilot trial, the calculated false-p
3240: ositive rate (excluding cases of primary peritoneal cancer, whic
3280: h were not reported) of CA-125 testing using a single cutoff val
32c0: ue was 4.2% across 3 screening rounds. In the PLCO trial, the ca
3300: lculated false-positive rate (including cases of primary periton
3340: eal cancer) of transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125 testing was 9.
3380: 6% across all 6 screening rounds.<sup>3</sup> Surgery to investi
33c0: gate positive screening test results among women who ultimately 
3400: did not have ovarian cancer occurred in 0.2% of participants in 
3440: the UK Pilot CA-125 group, 0.97% of participants in the UKCTOCS 
3480: CA-125 ROCA group, 3.25% of participants in the UKCTOCS ultrasou

3500: asound group.<sup>3</sup> Up to 15% of these women had major sur
3540: gical complications.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF identi
3580: fied limited evidence on the psychological harms of screening fo
35c0: r ovarian cancer from the UKCTOCS and QUEST trials.<sup>3, 19, 2
3600: 0</sup> The UKCTOCS trial measured anxiety in a subgroup of part
3640: icipants. Although no significant differences were found between
3680:  the intervention and control groups, there was a greater odds o
36c0: f psychological morbidity among women who were referred to highe
3700: r levels of screening.<sup>20</sup> The QUEST trial evaluated th
3740: e effect of screening for ovarian cancer on cancer worry and qua
3780: lity of life among average-risk US women 30 years and older. Can
37c0: cer screening consisted of alternating CA-125 testing and transv
3800: aginal ultrasound every 6 months, for a maximum of 4 screening r
3840: ounds. Although no statistically significant difference in cance
3880: r worry was found between study groups, the trial found that wom

3900: worry at 2 years of follow-up (odds ratio, 2.8 [95% CI, 1.1 to 7

3980: \n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The US
39c0: PSTF found adequate evidence that screening for ovarian cancer d
3a00: oes not reduce ovarian cancer mortality. Three large good-qualit
3a40: y studies all found no benefit in ovarian cancer mortality from 
3a80: annual screening in asymptomatic women not known to be at high r
3ac0: isk for ovarian cancer. The USPSTF also found adequate evidence 
3b00: from these 3 studies that the harms from screening for ovarian c
3b40: ancer are at least moderate and may be substantial in some cases
3b80: . Harms from screening for ovarian cancer include false-positive
3bc0:  results, which may lead to unnecessary diagnostic surgery to de
3c00: termine whether ovarian cancer is present, often resulting in re
3c40: moval of 1 or both of the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Serious s
3c80: urgical complications can also result. The USPSTF found the evid
3cc0: ence on psychological harms of screening to be inadequate and co
3d00: uld not draw any definitive conclusion on whether ovarian cancer
3d40:  screening causes psychological harms. Given the lack of mortali
3d80: ty benefit of screening, and the moderate to substantial harms t
3dc0: hat could result from false-positive screening test results and 
3e00: subsequent surgery, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty
3e40:  that the harms of screening for ovarian cancer with CA-125 test
3e80: ing (using a single cutoff value or the ROCA), transvaginal ultr
3ec0: asound, or both outweigh the benefit, and the net balance of the
3f00:  benefit and harms of screening is negative.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Resp

0740: Importance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Genital herpes is a prevalent sexually
0780:  transmitted infection (STI) in the United States; the Centers f
07c0: or Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that almost 1 
0800: in 6 persons aged 14 to 49 years have genital herpes.<sup>1</sup
0840: > Genital herpes infection is caused by 2 subtypes of HSV, HSV-1
0880:  and HSV-2. Unlike other infections for which screening is recom
08c0: mended, HSV infection may not have a long asymptomatic period du
0900: ring which screening, early identification, and treatment may al
0940: ter its course. Antiviral medications may provide symptomatic re
0980: lief from outbreaks; however, these medications do not cure HSV 
09c0: infection. Although vertical transmission of HSV can occur betwe
0a00: en an infected pregnant woman and her infant during vaginal deli
0a40: very, interventions can help reduce transmission. Neonatal herpe
0a80: s infection, while uncommon, can result in substantial morbidity
0ac0:  and mortality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Detection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the p
0b00: ast, most cases of genital herpes in the United States have been
0b40:  caused by infection with HSV-2. Adequate evidence suggests that
0b80:  the most widely used, currently available serologic screening t
0bc0: est for HSV-2 approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is
0c00:  not suitable for population-based screening, based on its low s
0c40: pecificity, the lack of widely available confirmatory testing, a
0c80: nd its high false-positive rate. Rates of genital herpes due to 
0cc0: HSV-1 infection in the United States may be increasing. While HS
0d00: V-1 infection can be identified by serologic tests, the tests ca
0d40: nnot determine if the site of infection is oral or genital; thus
0d80: , these serologic tests are not useful for screening for asympto

3780: ccuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>HerpeSelect (Focus Dia
37c0: gnostics), the most widely available serologic test for genital 
3800: HSV-2 infection approved by the US Food and Drug Administration,
3840:  has a pooled estimate of sensitivity of 99% (95% CI, 97 to 100)
3880:  and a pooled estimate of specificity of 83% (95% CI, 72 to 91).
38c0: <sup>22</sup> A second test, the Biokit HSV-2 Rapid Test (Biokit
3900:  USA), has a pooled estimate of sensitivity of 84% (95% CI, 73 t
3940: o 91) and specificity of 95% (95% CI, 93 to 97).<sup>22</sup> In
3980:  the general US population, the positive predictive value of may
39c0:  be as low as 75% for the Biokit test and as low as 50% for Herp
3a00: eSelect. Western blot is considered to be the gold standard for 
3a40: the serologic diagnosis of herpes. Western blot test results can
3a80:  be obtained by sending a blood sample to a single research labo
3ac0: ratory (University of Washington Clinical Virology Laboratory); 
3b00: however, it is not widely available as a screening or confirmato
3b40: ry test for persons who screen positive for HSV-2 on one of the 
3b80: less-specific, commercially available serologic tests. No studie
3bc0: s have examined the screening accuracy of serologic HSV tests in
3c00:  pregnant women. Serologic HSV tests may be clinically useful fo
3c40: r persons with persistent undiagnosed genital symptoms and in ot
3c80: her diagnostic settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early D
3cc0: etection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, there is no cur
3d00: e for genital HSV infection. Antiviral medications are generally
3d40:  used for the management of symptomatic outbreaks and for preven
3d80: tion in patients with a history of frequent symptomatic outbreak
3dc0: s. In studies, many persons identified with asymptomatic genital
3e00:  herpes (ie, they have been infected with HSV-2 and have never e
3e40: xperienced symptoms) have a symptomatic outbreak within 6 months
3e80:  of testing. The increasing percentage of genital herpes cases c
3ec0: aused by HSV-1 also limits the potential benefit of serologic sc
3f00: reening in asymptomatic persons. While HSV-1 infection can be de
3f40: tected through serologic tests, these tests cannot determine the
3f80:  site of HSV infection. Since HSV-1 can cause both oral and geni
3fc0: tal herpes infections, and oral herpes infection is ver
<= Recv data, 16375 bytes (0x3ff7)

0080: te to determine if suppressive antiviral therapy reduces transmi
00c0: ssion of genital HSV infection between serodiscordant couples wi
0100: th an asymptomatic partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pregnant adolescents a
0140: nd women with new or known history of genital HSV infection shou
0180: ld be carefully observed during pregnancy. To reduce the chance 
01c0: of HSV transmission to the infant during delivery, women with ac
0200: tive genital HSV lesions at the time of birth are usually offere
0240: d the option of cesarean delivery. No studies have examined the 
0280: effectiveness of antiviral therapy to decrease the risk for HSV 
02c0: transmission to pregnant women by an infected partner.</p>\r\n\r
0300: \n<h3>Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>
0340: Serologic screening in asymptomatic persons will likely result i
0380: n a large number of false-positive results. Given the limitation
03c0: s of currently available tests, 1 of 2 positive results may be f
0400: alse. Given the test characteristics of the most widely used ser
0440: ologic screening test for HSV-2 and a population infection preva
0480: lence of 15%, screening 10,000 persons would result in approxima
04c0: tely 1485 true-positive and 1445 false-positive results. Confirm
0500: atory testing is not currently widely available and is only perf
0540: ormed at a single research laboratory. There are social and emot
0580: ional harms of receiving a false-positive result, in addition to
05c0:  the potential harms of unnecessary treatment with preventive an
0600: tiviral medications.<sup>23, 24</sup> However, antiviral medicat
0640: ions are generally considered to have few harms in nonpregnant a
0680: dults.<sup>21</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net 
06c0: Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the natural history of HSV infec
0700: tion, its epidemiology, and the available evidence on the accura
0740: cy of serologic screening tests, the USPSTF found adequate evide
0780: nce to bound the potential benefits and harms and conclude with 
07c0: moderate certainty that the harms outweigh the benefits of serol
0800: ogic screening for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic adolesc
0840: ents and adults, including those who are pregnant.</p>\r\n\r\n<h
0880: 3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of t
08c0: his recommendation statement was posted for public comment on th
0900: e USPSTF website from August 2 to August 29, 2016. The USPSTF re
0940: viewed and considered all comments received during this period. 
0980: Several comments supported the USPSTF&#39;s analysis and conclus
09c0: ions; some comments noted that the recommendation is consistent 
0a00: with current clinical practice and advice from other organizatio
0a40: ns, including the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians

04c0: f this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on
0500:  the USPSTF website from September 12, 2017, through October 13,
0540:  2017. Many comments pointed to a need for greater clarity in de
0580: scribing differences between cotesting and primary hrHPV testing
05c0: . Several comments requested clarification on the information pr
0600: esented in the modeling report. Some comments highlighted implem
0640: entation issues due to a lack of tests approved by the US Food a
0680: nd Drug Administration for primary cervical cancer screening. In
06c0:  response to these comments, the USPSTF now notes throughout the
0700:  recommendation statement that women aged 30 to 65 years may cho
0740: ose to get screened every 3 years with cervical cytology alone, 
0780: every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone, or every 5 years with co
07c0: testing. Accordingly, the USPSTF provided a table in the Clinica
0800: l Considerations section that presents detailed information abou
0840: t the available evidence on the effectiveness, strengths, limita
0880: tions, and unique considerations of each screening method. For f
08c0: urther clarification on the modeling study, the USPSTF added the
0900:  calibrated input parameter values, which should enable informed
0940:  readers to assess the estimates used. The USPSTF added language
0980:  throughout the recommendation statement to emphasize the import
09c0: ance of several different factors that affect overall screening 
0a00: effectiveness, including the primary screening test, screening a
0a40: ges, screening interval, test characteristics, and follow-up pro
0a80: tocols, including triage of screen-positive women.</p>","topic":

1c40: he age-adjusted prevalence of coronary artery disease among US a
1c80: dults aged 45 to 64 years was 6.1%, compared with 16.4% among th

1e00: n/Alaskan Native adults than Asian adults (9.3% vs 3.7%, respect

2440: p>Accurate identification of persons at high risk for CVD events
2480: , particularly nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, and CVD
24c0:  death provides the opportunity for more intensive risk factor m

2540: , identifying persons at low risk may allow for a reduction in i
2580: nterventions with a low benefit to risk ratio for those not like
25c0: ly to benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several traditional risk factors ar
2600: e associated with higher risk for CVD events, including older ag
2640: e, male sex, high blood pressure, current smoking, abnormal chol
2680: esterol levels, diabetes, obesity, and physical inactivity. Risk
26c0:  factors can be combined in many ways to classify a person&rsquo
2700: ;s risk for a CVD event as low, intermediate, or high. Several c
2740: alculators and models are available to quantify a person&rsquo;s
2780:  10-year CVD event risk. The Framingham Risk Score (which estima
27c0: tes a person&rsquo;s 10-year risk of coronary heart disease) was
2800:  1 of the first widely used risk assessment tools. Persons with 
2840: a 10-year CVD event risk greater than 20% are generally consider
2880: ed at high risk, those with a 10-year risk less than 10% are con
28c0: sidered at low risk, and those in the 10% to 20% range are consi
2900: dered at intermediate risk. The Pooled Cohort Equations (which e
2940: stimate 10-year risk of myocardial infarction, death from corona
2980: ry heart disease, or stroke) were introduced in 2013 and were de
29c0: veloped using more contemporary and diverse cohort data, with th
2a00: e inclusion of race/ethnicity and diabetes. Persons with a 10-ye
2a40: ar CVD event risk less than 7.5% are considered at low risk, and
2a80:  those with a 10-year risk of 7.5% or greater are considered at 
2ac0: high risk.<sup>4</sup> The distribution of estimated CVD risk in
2b00:  the US population is highly influenced by age and sex. Populati
2b40: on estimates of the distribution of 10-year CVD event risk asses
2b80: sed by the Pooled Cohort Equations, which categorize risk using 
2bc0: somewhat different thresholds, and using 2001-2010 data from the
2c00:  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey show that the 
2c40: vast majority of US adults aged 40 to 49 years have an estimated
2c80:  10-year CVD event risk of 7% or less (93% of women and 81% of m
2cc0: en). Among US adults aged 50 to 59 years, 80% of women and 46% o
2d00: f men have an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7% or less; 42
2d40: % of women and 7% of men aged 60 to 69 years have an estimated 1

3580: y 16, 2018, to February 12, 2018. Many comments expressed belief
35c0:  that the evidence for risk assessment with CAC score was strong
3600:  enough to warrant a separate positive recommendation. Although 
3640: adding CAC score to traditional risk assessment models improved 
3680: discrimination and reclassification, the USPSTF found inadequate
36c0:  evidence that this change would translate into improved health 
3700: outcomes among asymptomatic patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several comm
3740: ents expressed concern that the USPSTF overestimated the harms a
3780: ssociated with CAC score testing (radiation exposure, downstream
37c0:  testing). The USPSTF added language to clarify that it determin
3800: ed that the harms associated with the addition of nontraditional
3840:  risk factors, including CAC score, are small in magnitude.</p>\
3880: r\n\r\n<p>Several comments noted that the addition of nontraditi
38c0: onal risk factors, especially CAC score, is useful for patients 
3900: whose risk stratification is unclear or for those who fall into 
3940: intermediate-risk groups. The USPSTF did not find convincing evi
3980: dence that adding nontraditional risk factors to traditional ris
39c0: k factors improves reclassification in intermediate-risk groups.
3a00:  As clinical practice moves toward a single threshold for treatm
3a40: ent, this concern may no longer be relevant in clinical decision
3a80:  making. Some comments also expressed belief that CAC score test
3ac0: ing leads to better adherence to preventive therapies (ie, medic
3b00: ations and lifestyle changes). The USPSTF carefully reviewed the
3b40:  available evidence and concluded that CAC score testing showed 
3b80: no benefit over traditional CVD risk assessment in preventive me
3bc0: dication use or risk factor control. The USPSTF added language t

3c40:  including more information on the differences between the Frami

3d00: the Clinical Considerations section to clarify these differences
3d40:  and provide more information on risk in the general US populati
3d80: on. Last, comments noted that the USPSTF assessment may not be a

1400: \n\r\n<p>In deciding which postmenopausal women younger than 65 
1440: years to screen with bone measurement testing, clinicians should
1480:  first consider factors associated with increased risk of osteop
14c0: orotic fractures. These include parental history of hip fracture
1500: , smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and low body weight. I
1540: n addition, menopausal status in women is also an important cons
1580: ideration because studies demonstrating treatment benefit mainly
15c0:  enrolled postmenopausal women. For postmenopausal women younger
1600:  than 65 years who have at least 1 risk factor, a reasonable app
1640: roach to determine who should be screened with bone measurement 
1680: testing is to use a clinical risk assessment tool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p
16c0: >Several tools are available to assess osteoporosis risk: the Si
1700: mple Calculated Osteoporosis Risk Estimation (SCORE; Merck), Ost
1740: eoporosis Risk Assessment Instrument (ORAI), Osteoporosis Index 
1780: of Risk (OSIRIS), and the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool (OST
17c0: ). These tools seem to perform similarly and are moderately accu
1800: rate at predicting osteoporosis. The FRAX tool (University of Sh
1840: effield), which assesses a person&rsquo;s 10-year risk of fractu
1880: re, is also a commonly used tool. The FRAX tool includes questio
18c0: ns about previous DXA results but does not require this informat
1900: ion to estimate fracture risk. Because the benefits of treatment
1940:  are greater in persons at higher risk of fracture, one approach
1980:  is to perform bone measurement testing in postmenopausal women 
19c0: younger than 65 years who have a 10-year FRAX risk of major oste
1a00: oporotic fracture (MOF) (without DXA) greater than that of a 65-
1a40: year-old white woman without major risk factors. For example, in
1a80:  the United States, a 65-year-old white woman of mean height and
1ac0:  weight<sup>7</sup> without major risk factors has a 10-year FRA
1b00: X risk of MOF of 8.4%.<sup>4,8</sup> In comparison, a 60-year-ol
1b40: d white woman of mean height and weight<sup>7</sup> with a paren
1b80: tal history of hip fracture has a 10-year FRAX risk of MOF of 13
1bc0: %.<sup>4,8</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinicians should note that the p
1c00: resence of a given risk factor or a certain age does not represe
1c40: nt a particular risk threshold. Although the risk of osteoporosi
1c80: s and osteoporotic fractures generally increases with age, the p
1cc0: resence of multiple risk factors at a younger age may indicate t
1d00: hat the risk-benefit profile is favorable for screening with bon
1d40: e measurement testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Screening T
1d80: ests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The most commonly used bone measurement test
1dc0:  used to screen for osteoporosis is central DXA; other screening
1e00:  tests include peripheral DXA and quantitative ultrasound (QUS).
1e40:  Central DXA measures BMD at the hip and lumbar spine. Most trea
1e80: tment guidelines<sup>3,4,9-11</sup> recommend using BMD, as meas
1ec0: ured by central DXA, to define osteoporosis and the treatment th
1f00: reshold to prevent osteoporotic fractures.<sup>4,12</sup> All th
1f40: e osteoporosis drug therapy studies reviewed by the USPSTF used 
1f80: central DXA to determine eligibility for study enrollment.<sup>4
1fc0: ,6</sup> Peripheral DXA measures BMD at the lower forearm and he
2000: el. Quantitative ultrasound also evaluates peripheral sites and 
2040: has similar accuracy in predicting fracture risk as DXA, while a
2080: voiding the risk of radiation exposure; however, it does not mea
20c0: sure BMD. Peripheral DXA and QUS are measured with portable devi
2100: ces and may be less costly and more accessible than central DXA 
2140: measurement (<a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Scre
2180: ening Intervals</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some observational and modeling s
21c0: tudies have suggested screening intervals based on age, baseline
2200:  BMD, and calculated projected time to transition to osteoporosi
2240: s. However, limited evidence from 2 good-quality studies found n
2280: o benefit in predicting fractures from repeating bone measuremen
22c0: t testing 4 to 8 years after initial screening.<sup>4</sup></p>\
2300: r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Food a
2340: nd Drug Administration (FDA) has approved multiple drug therapie
2380: s to reduce osteoporotic fractures, including bisphosphonates, p
23c0: arathyroid hormone, raloxifene, and estrogen. The choice of ther
2400: apy should be an individual one based on the patient&#39;s clini
2440: cal situation and the trade-off between benefits and harms. Clin
2480: icians should educate patients on how to minimize the adverse ef
24c0: fects of drug therapies, such as reducing esophageal irritation 
2500: from bisphosphonate therapy by taking the medication with a full
2540:  glass of water and not lying down for at least 30 minutes after
2580: ward.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Suggestions for Practice Reg
25c0: arding the I Statement</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When deciding whether to s
2600: creen for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures in men,
2640:  clinicians should consider the following factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h
2680: 3 align=\"left\">Potential Preventable Burden</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The
26c0:  prevalence of osteoporosis in men is generally lower than in wo
2700: men (4.3% vs 15.4%, respectively).<sup>1</sup> An estimated 1 to
2740:  2 million men in the United States have osteoporosis.<sup>5</su
2780: p> Although men account for 29% of osteoporotic fractures in the
27c0:  United States, men have higher fracture-related morbidity and m
2800: ortality rates than women.<sup>3,4</sup> Each year, about 80,000
2840:  men in the United States will have a hip fracture; 1 in 3 men w
2880: ho experience a hip fracture will die within a year.<sup>13</sup
28c0: ></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Older age in men is an important risk factor for
2900:  osteoporotic fracture. In the absence of other risk factors, it
2940:  is not until age 80 years that the prevalence of osteoporosis i
2980: n white men starts to reach that of white women at age 65 years.
29c0: <sup>1</sup> For example, in the United States, the 10-year FRAX
2a00:  risk of MOF is 5.0%<sup>8</sup> in a 65-year-old white man of m
2a40: ean height and weight<sup>7</sup> without any risk factors, and 
2a80: 8.4%<sup>8</sup> at age 80 years (vs 8.4% in a 65-year-old white
2ac0:  woman of mean height and weight<sup>7</sup> without any risk fa
2b00: ctors<sup>8</sup>). In the presence of multiple risk factors, th
2b40: e 10-year FRAX risk of MOF in a 55-year-old white man can approx
2b80: imate the risk of a 65-year-old white woman with no risk factors
2bc0: ; for example, the 10-year FRAX risk of MOF is 8.9% in a 55-year
2c00: -old white man of mean height and weight<sup>7</sup> with a pare
2c40: ntal history of hip fracture who currently smokes and drinks 3 o
2c80: r more units of alcohol per day.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simil
2cc0: ar to women, risk factors for fractures in men include low body 
2d00: mass index, excessive alcohol consumption, current smoking, long
2d40: -term corticosteroid use, previous fractures, and history of fal
2d80: ls within the past year. A recent systematic review of risk fact
2dc0: ors for osteoporosis in men also found that hypogonadism, histor
2e00: y of cerebrovascular accident, and history of diabetes are assoc
2e40: iated with an increased risk of fractures, although their clinic
2e80: al use in identifying men who need further bone measurement test
2ec0: ing is unclear.<sup>4,14</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although clinical r
2f00: isk assessment tools and imaging tests to diagnose osteoporosis 
2f40: seem to perform as well in men as in women, evidence on the effe
2f80: ctiveness of medications to treat osteoporosis in men is lacking
2fc0: .<sup>4,6</sup> Although some treatments have been found to be e
3000: ffective in preventing fractures in postmenopausal women with os
3040: teoporosis, it cannot be assumed that they will be equally effec

17c0:  align=\"left\">DXA</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Bone measurement testing with
1800:  central DXA is the most commonly used and studied method for th
1840: e diagnosis of osteoporosis. Central DXA uses radiation to measu
1880: re BMD at central bone sites (hip and lumbar spine), which is th
18c0: e established standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis and for gui
1900: ding decisions about treatment. DXA can also be used at peripher
1940: al bone sites (such as the lower forearm and heel) to identify p
1980: ersons with low bone mass; however, most treatment guidelines re
19c0: commend follow-up with central DXA before initiating treatment f

1a40:  techniques may help increase access to screening in geographic 
1a80: locations (eg, rural areas) where machines that perform central 
1ac0: DXA may not be available. The USPSTF identified 2 studies (n = 7
1b00: 12) that reported on the accuracy of peripheral DXA at the calca
1b40: neus to identify osteoporosis; compared with central DXA, the ar
1b80: ea under the curve (AUC) ranged from 0.67 to 0.80 in women with 
1bc0: a mean age of 61 years.<sup>4,32,33</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\

1c40: aging technique used at peripheral bone sites (most commonly the
1c80:  calcaneus), and it does not require radiation exposure. Compare
1cc0: d with central DXA, the AUC for QUS measured at the calcaneus in

1e00: ever, QUS does not measure BMD, that is the current diagnostic c

2240: , and SCORE (8 studies; n...=...15,362). The pooled AUCs for the
2280: se tools were all similar and ranged from 0.65 to 0.70. The FRAX
22c0:  tool (without BMD), which has been studied extensively as a cli

2340: milarly in its ability to identify osteoporosis (AUC range, 0.58

2100: ":"<h2>Rationale</h2><h3>Importance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Menopause is 
2140: defined as the permanent cessation of a woman&rsquo;s menstrual 
2180: cycle. It is typically defined in retrospect, 12 months after a 
21c0: woman&rsquo;s final menstrual period. Menopause occurs at a medi
2200: an age of 51.3 years, and the average US woman who reaches menop
2240: ause is expected to live another 30 years. The prevalence and in
2280: cidence of most chronic conditions, such as coronary heart disea
22c0: se, dementia, stroke, fractures, and breast cancer, increase wit
2300: h age; however, the excess risk for these conditions that can be
2340:  attributed to menopause alone is uncertain. Since the publicati
2380: on of findings from the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative (WHI) th
23c0: at hormone therapy use was associated with serious adverse healt
2400: h effects in postmenopausal women, use of menopausal hormone the
2440: rapy has declined, from 44% of US women using or having used hor

2000: for the large number of tests conducted), as well as the small n
2040: umber of events that occurred for some of these outcomes in the 
2080: estrogen-alone trial subgroups, limit the strength of these find
20c0: ings. These limitations, along with the absence of significant s
2100: ubgroup effects for most outcomes, led the USPSTF to conclude th
2140: at the evidence was inadequate to determine that any subgroup ha
2180: d a different balance of benefits and harms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To da
21c0: te, evidence to determine whether different types, doses, or mod
2200: es of delivery of hormone therapy have a different balance of be
2240: nefits and harms is limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Timing of Preventive
2280:  Medication</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It has been proposed that hormone the
22c0: rapy initiated closer to the time of menopause may have a more b
2300: eneficial, or less deleterious, effect on risk of coronary heart
2340:  disease (and possibly other health outcomes) than hormone thera
2380: py initiated later; this proposal has been termed the timing hyp
23c0: othesis. Findings from post hoc subgroup analyses of the WHI tri
2400: al regarding the effect of timing of hormone therapy initiation 
2440: on the risk of coronary events are conflicting. In 1 subgroup an
2480: alysis, women randomized to combined estrogen and progestin with
24c0: in 10 years of menopause did not have the increased risk of coro
2500: nary heart disease observed in women randomized to hormone thera
2540: py more than 20 years postmenopause; however, there was also no 
2580: beneficial effect in the former group. In contrast, a second sub
25c0: group analysis that considered prior hormone therapy use (ie, be
2600: fore trial enrollment), which provides a more accurate assessmen
2640: t of the time between menopause and initiation of hormone therap
2680: y, found no difference in coronary risk between early (&lt;5 yea
26c0: rs) vs late (&ge;5 years) initiation of hormone therapy. It is i
2700: mportant to note that all such post hoc analyses should be consi
2740: dered exploratory (hypothesis forming) and not confirmatory in n
2780: ature, and are also subject to potential bias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To 
27c0: date, no good-quality randomized trials have prospectively evalu
2800: ated the effect of timing of hormone therapy initiation relative
2840:  to the onset of menopause on associated benefits and harms.</p>
2880: \r\n\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>
28c0: Although the use of hormone therapy to prevent chronic condition
2900: s in postmenopausal women is associated with some benefits, ther
2940: e are also well-documented harms. The USPSTF determined that the
2980:  magnitude of both the benefits and the harms of hormone therapy
29c0:  in postmenopausal women is small to moderate. Therefore, the US
2a00: PSTF concludes with moderate certainty that combined estrogen an
2a40: d progestin has no net benefit for the primary prevention of chr
2a80: onic conditions in most postmenopausal women with an intact uter
2ac0: us and that estrogen alone has no net benefit for the primary pr
2b00: evention of chronic conditions in most postmenopausal women who 
2b40: have had a hysterectomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit Wi
2b80: th Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditionally, estro
2bc0: gen has been viewed as having cardioprotective effects. The inci
2c00: dence of coronary heart disease in premenopausal women is lower 
2c40: than in men of the same age; this difference decreases as women 
2c80: age past menopause. Estrogen decreases levels of low-density lip
2cc0: oprotein cholesterol, increases levels of high-density lipoprote
2d00: in cholesterol, and has a vasodilator effect. Despite these obse
2d40: rvations, data from randomized clinical trials show a lack of be
2d80: nefit, or even a harmful effect, of hormone therapy on risk of c
2dc0: oronary heart disease in postmenopausal women. Several potential
2e00:  factors, including timing of initiation of hormone therapy with
2e40:  respect to menopause, older age, and presence of atheroma, have
2e80:  been proposed to account for these discrepant findings. Nonethe
2ec0: less, the underlying causes of this lack of benefit are uncertai
2f00: n.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another discrepant finding is that combined est
2f40: rogen and progestin is associated with a small increase in the r
2f80: isk of breast cancer, while estrogen alone appears to slightly r
2fc0: educe this risk. Although estrogen generally stimulates breast c
3000: ell proliferation, some preclinical studies have shown that estr
3040: ogen can induce breast cell apoptosis if administered under cond
3080: itions of estrogen deprivation, and that progestin can stimulate
30c0:  breast cell proliferation and formation of new blood vessels. T
3100: hese findings have been proposed as a possible explanation for t
3140: he apparent discrepant effects of combined estrogen and progesti
3180: n and estrogen alone on breast cancer risk.<sup>32</sup></p>\r\n
31c0: \r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft versio
3200: n of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment
3240:  on the USPSTF website from May 16 to June 12, 2017. In response
3280:  to public comment, the USPSTF modified the title of the recomme
32c0: ndation statement to clarify that the patient population under c
3300: onsideration consists of postmenopausal women. The USPSTF clarif
3340: ied that it reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of s
3380: ystemic menopausal hormone therapy (ie, administered orally or t
33c0: ransdermally), not local hormone therapy (eg, creams or rings). 
3400: The USPSTF also provided additional details about the WHI trial,
3440:  specifying the formulation of hormone therapy used and the aver
3480: age age of women enrolled in the trial. The USPSTF added 2 table
34c0: s showing the absolute risk increase or decrease of various heal
3500: th outcomes in women receiving combined estrogen and progestin o
3540: r estrogen alone (<a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#t
3580: ab2\">Table 2</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to comments that s
35c0: ome subgroups of women (eg, women aged 50 to 59 years taking est
3600: rogen alone) experience a more beneficial balance of benefits an
3640: d harms than the overall group of women in the WHI trial, the US
3680: PSTF expanded its discussion on the interaction between age and 
36c0: health outcomes in the WHI trial in the &ldquo;Discussion&rdquo;
3700:  section. The USPSTF also clarified that the WHI analyses that a
3740: ssessed whether time between menopause and initiation of hormone
3780:  therapy affects the benefits and harms of hormone therapy were 
37c0: conducted post hoc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF added the word &ldq
3800: uo;primary&rdquo; to the recommendation summary to further highl
3840: ight that this recommendation statement focuses on the use of ho
3880: rmone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions i
38c0: n postmenopausal women, not on its use for the treatment of vaso
3900: motor, vulvovaginal, or other symptoms. The USPSTF is tasked wit
3940: h evaluating the benefits and harms of clinical preventive servi
3980: ces in generally asymptomatic populations; therefore, the treatm
39c0: ent of symptoms is outside of its purview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USP
3a00: STF agrees with comments regarding the importance of individuali
3a40: zed and shared decision making, and states so in the preamble to
3a80:  each recommendation statement. Last, the USPSTF clarified the d
3ac0: efinition of menopause in the &ldquo;Rationale&rdquo; section an

3e00: er adults in the United States.<sup>1</sup> In 2014, 28.7% of co

0080:  of risk factors functional tests, or both involving gait, balan
00c0: ce, or mobility to identify study participants, history of falls
0100:  was the most commonly used factor that consistently identified 
0140: persons at high risk for falls.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early
0180:  Intervention</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence 
01c0: that exercise interventions have a moderate benefit in preventin
0200: g falls in older adults at increased risk for falls. The USPSTF 
0240: found adequate evidence that multifactorial interventions have a
0280:  small benefit in preventing falls in older adults at increased 
02c0: risk for falls. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that vitamin 
0300: D supplementation has no benefit in preventing falls in older ad
0340: ults.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Harms of Early Intervention</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>
0380: Based on the noninvasive nature of most of the interventions, th
03c0: e low likelihood of serious harms, and the available information
0400:  from studies reporting few serious harms, the USPSTF found adeq
0440: uate evidence to bound the harms of exercise and multifactorial 
0480: interventions as no greater than small. The USPSTF found adequat
04c0: e evidence that the overall harms of vitamin D supplementation a

0a40: ry of falls is generally considered together or sequentially wit

0ac0: gait, and balance. A pragmatic approach to identifying persons a

0c40: ventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Exercise Interventions</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>E
0c80: ffective exercise interventions include supervised individual an
0cc0: d group classes and physical therapy, although most studies revi
0d00: ewed by the USPSTF included group exercise. Given the heterogene
0d40: ity of interventions reviewed by the USPSTF, it is difficult to 
0d80: identify specific components of exercise that are particularly e
0dc0: fficacious. The most common exercise component was gait, balance
0e00: , and functional training (17 trials), followed by resistance tr
0e40: aining (13 trials), flexibility (8 trials), and endurance traini
0e80: ng (5 trials). Three studies included tai chi, and 5 studies inc
0ec0: luded general physical activity. The most common frequency and d
0f00: uration for exercise interventions was 3 sessions per week for 1
0f40: 2 months, although duration of exercise interventions ranged fro
0f80: m 2 to 42 months.<sup>8</sup> The 2008 US Department of Health a
0fc0: nd Human Services guidelines recommended that older adults get a
1000: t least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes
1040:  per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, as we
1080: ll as muscle-strengthening activities twice per week.<sup>9</sup

1180: factorial Interventions</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Multifactorial interventi
11c0: ons include an initial assessment of modifiable risk factors for
1200:  falls and subsequent customized interventions for each patient 
1240: based on issues identified in the initial assessment. The initia
1280: l assessment could include a multidisciplinary comprehensive ger
12c0: iatric assessment or an assessment using a combination of variou
1300: s components, such as balance, gait, vision, postural blood pres
1340: sure, medication, environment, cognition, and psychological heal

13c0: and a number of different professionals performed subsequent int
1400: erventions, including nurses, clinicians, physical therapists, e
1440: xercise instructors, occupational therapists, dieticians, or nut
1480: ritionists. Intervention components vary based on the initial as
14c0: sessment and could include group or individual exercise, psychol

1540: herapy, education, medication management, urinary incontinence m

18c0: falls, and the USPSTF has issued 2 related recommendation statem
1900: ents on the prevention of fractures. The USPSTF recommends scree
1940: ning for osteoporosis in women 65 years or older and in younger 
1980: women at increased risk.<sup>11</sup> In its recommendation on v
19c0: itamin D and calcium supplementation to prevent fractures, the U
1a00: SPSTF states that it found insufficient evidence on vitamin D or
1a40:  calcium supplementation to prevent fractures in men, premenopau
1a80: sal women at any dose, and in postmenopausal women at doses grea
1ac0: ter than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium
1b00: ; the USPSTF recommends against supplementation with 400 IU or l
1b40: ess of vitamin D or 1000 mg or less of calcium in postmenopausal
1b80:  women.<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Contr
1bc0: ol and Prevention has published guidance on implementing communi
1c00: ty-based interventions to prevent falls.<sup>13</sup></p><h2>Oth
1c40: er Considerations</h2><h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although
1c80:  the evidence does not support routinely performing an in-depth 
1cc0: multifactorial risk assessment with comprehensive management in 
1d00: all older adults, there may be reasons for providing this servic
1d40: e to certain patients. Important items in the patient&#39;s medi
1d80: cal history could include the circumstances of prior falls and t
1dc0: he presence of comorbid medical conditions. The American Geriatr
1e00: ic Society (AGS) recommends multifactorial risk assessment with 
1e40: multicomponent interventions in older adults who have had 2 fall
1e80: s in the past year (1 fall if combined with gait or balance prob
1ec0: lems), have gait or balance problems, or present with an acute f
1f00: all.<sup>14</sup> According to the AGS, evaluation of balance an
1f40: d mobility, vision, and orthostatic or postural hypotension are 
1f80: effective components of multifactorial risk assessment with comp
1fc0: rehensive management, as well as review of medication use and ho
2000: me environment.<sup>14</sup> Follow-up and comprehensive managem
2040: ent of identified risk factors are essential to the effectivenes
2080: s of this strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The burden of falls on patient
20c0: s and the health care system is large. Reducing the incidence of
2100:  falls would also improve the socialization and functioning of o
2140: lder adults who have previously fallen and fear falling again. M
2180: any other interventions could potentially be useful to prevent f
21c0: alls, but because of the heterogeneity in the target patient pop
2200: ulation, heterogeneity (ie, multiplicity) of predisposing factor
2240: s, and their additive or synergistic nature, the effectiveness o
2280: f other interventions is not known. However, many interventions 
22c0: with insufficient evidence to support their use to prevent falls
2300:  have other arguments that support their use.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Res
2340: earch Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies are needed on the cl
2380: inical validation of primary care tools to identify older adults
23c0:  at increased risk for falls. More efficacy trials are needed on
2400:  how the following interventions may help prevent falls if offer
2440: ed alone and not as part of multifactorial interventions: enviro
2480: nmental modification, medication management, and psychological i
24c0: nterventions. Additional research is needed on the effectiveness
2500:  of interventions in different age groups, in particular adults 
2540: older than 85 years. Additional research to identify effective c
2580: omponents of exercise interventions would also be useful.</p><h2
25c0: >Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>The USPSTF last
2600:  issued a recommendation on interventions to prevent falls in ol
2640: der adults in 2012. At that time, consistent with the current re
2680: commendation statement, the USPSTF recommended exercise (B recom
26c0: mendation) and selectively offering multifactorial interventions
2700:  (C recommendation) to prevent falls in community-dwelling older
2740:  adults at increased risk for falls. At that time, the USPSTF al
2780: so recommended vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls (B rec
27c0: ommendation), based on previous evidence that found a reduction 
2800: in the number of persons experiencing a fall. The current review
2840:  excluded studies considered in the previous review that enrolle
2880: d persons with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency because, on
28c0:  further consideration, vitamin D supplementation in these exami
2900: ned additional fall-related outcomes, including incident falls (
2940: in addition to the number of persons experiencing a fall, which 
2980: was considered in the previous review). With this revised scope 
29c0: of review, as well as newer evidence from trials reporting no be
2a00: nefit, the USPSTF found that vitamin D supplementation has no be
2a40: nefit in falls prevention in community-dwelling older adults not
2a80:  known to have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. Thus, the 
2ac0: USPSTF now recommends against vitamin D supplementation for the 
2b00: prevention of falls in community-dwelling older adults.</p>","ot
2b40: her":"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>The National Institut
2b80: e on Aging outlines similar interventions for the prevention of

2c40:  and vision, and medication management.<sup>30</sup> According t
2c80: o the AGS, detecting a history of falls is fundamental to a fall
2cc0: s reduction program, and it recommends asking all older adults o
2d00: nce a year about falls.<sup>14</sup> The AGS further recommends 
2d40: that older persons who have experienced a fall should have their
2d80:  gait and balance assessed using one of the available evaluation
2dc0: s; those who cannot perform or perform poorly on a standardized 
2e00: gait and balance test should be given a multifactorial falls ris
2e40: k assessment that includes a focused medical history, physical e
2e80: xamination, functional assessment, and an environmental assessme

3c40: ntion studies (40/62) reviewed by the USPSTF targeted patients a
3c80: t high risk for falls.<sup>8, 10</sup> However, studies used var
3cc0: iable approaches to identify high-risk patients. Most commonly, 
3d00: studies used history of prior falls to identify persons at high 
3d40: risk for future falls (16 studies).<sup>8</sup> Other trials eva
3d80: luated 2 or more risk factors, such as history of prior falls, d
3dc0: ifficulty with mobility, and use of health care, and included pa
3e00: rticipants with any of these risk factors. Studies that evaluate
3e40: d exercise interventions most commonly used physical function or
3e80:  mobility limitation problems to identify high-risk populations.

2140:  used 1-hydroxycholecalciferol (1 &mu;g per day) and another use
2180: d calcitriol (0.25 &mu;g twice per day).<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n\r\n
21c0: <h4>Other Interventions</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found evidence
2200:  on other interventions, including environmental modification (3
2240:  studies; n=2175), medication management (2 studies; n=266), psy
2280: chological interventions (2 studies; n=929), and multiple interv
22c0: entions (6 studies; n=1770).<sup>8</sup> Multiple interventions 
2300: provided at least 2 intervention components but were not customi
2340: zed to individual participants. Studies of these other intervent
2380: ions were too few, too small, and too heterogeneous for the USPS
23c0: TF to draw any definitive conclusions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Other Outc
2400: omes</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The effect of interventions to prevent falls
2440:  on functional status or quality of life remains uncertain. The 
2480: few trials reporting quality of life, activities of daily living
24c0: , or independent activities of daily living showed no benefit, b
2500: ut these studies used different scales, and few were adequately 
2540: powered to detect differences in these outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>
2580: Potential Harms of Preventive Measures</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence o
25c0: n harms was reported in a subset of trials reporting on the effe
2600: ctiveness of interventions. Eight studies (n=4107) evaluating ex
2640: ercise interventions reported on harms; in general, adverse even
2680: ts were minor.<sup>8, 10</sup> The most common adverse events in
26c0: cluded pain or bruising related to exercise. One study reported 
2700: 1 wrist fracture in the intervention group<sup>21</sup> and anot
2740: her study reported a rate of 2.6 serious fall injuries per 100,0
2780: 00 physical activity sessions.<sup>22</sup> Only 2 trials report
27c0: ed on harms in control groups for comparison and found no betwee
2800: n-group difference in the rate of serious injuries.<sup>8</sup> 
2840: For multifactorial interventions, 4 studies (n=1466) reported on
2880:  harms.<sup>8</sup> In general, reported harms were rare, minor,
28c0:  and associated with the exercise component of the intervention.
2900:  Five studies (n=3955) on vitamin D supplementation reported no 
2940: difference in the frequency of harms between intervention and co
2980: ntrol groups.<sup>8</sup> However, as mentioned previously, the 
29c0: study using the highest dose of vitamin D (500,000 IU per year) 
2a00: reported an increase in falls, injurious falls, and the number o
2a40: f persons experiencing falls.<sup>19</sup> Other reported harms 
2a80: were rare and included kidney stones, diabetes, transient hyperc
2ac0: alcemia, and hypercalciuria; it was unclear if these rare harms 
2b00: were attributable to vitamin D supplementation. However, in a se
2b40: parate evidence review commissioned by the USPSTF on vitamin D s
2b80: upplementation to prevent fractures, the incidence of kidney sto
2bc0: nes increased with combined vitamin D and calcium supplementatio
2c00: n (based on evidence from 3 studies, including the large Women&r
2c40: squo;s Health Initiative trial).<sup>23, 24</sup> Three studies 
2c80: (n=810) on multiple interventions reported no adverse or severe 
2cc0: adverse events, although ascertainment of adverse events was unc
2d00: lear.<sup>8</sup> One study on a single psychological interventi
2d40: on reported no adverse events.<sup>25</sup> The remaining studie
2d80: s did not report on harms or adverse events.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Esti
2dc0: mate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found
2e00:  adequate evidence that exercise reduces the risk for falls by a
2e40:  moderate amount. Studies found reductions across several fall-r
2e80: elated outcomes. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the
2ec0:  harms of exercise as no greater than small. Potential harms inc
2f00: lude pain and bruising from exercise or a paradoxical increase i
2f40: n falls. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that exerc
2f80: ise confers a moderate net benefit in the reduction of falls.</p
2fc0: >\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that multifactori
3000: al interventions reduce the risk for falls by a small amount. Po
3040: oled analyses revealed statistically significant reductions in 1
3080:  fall-related outcome (number of falls) but not others (eg, numb
30c0: er of persons experiencing a fall). The USPSTF found adequate ev
3100: idence to bound the harms of multifactorial interventions as no 
3140: greater than small. Most reported harms seem to arise from the e
3180: xercise components of interventions. The USPSTF concludes with m
31c0: oderate certainty that multifactorial interventions confer a sma
3200: ll net benefit in the reduction of falls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPS
3240: TF found adequate evidence that vitamin D supplementation does n
3280: ot prevent falls. Pooled analyses show no effect of vitamin D su
32c0: pplementation on the number of falls or the number of persons ex
3300: periencing a fall. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the h
3340: arms of vitamin D supplementation are small to moderate. A study
3380:  of annual high-dose vitamin D supplementation showed an increas
33c0: e in falls. Adequate evidence from a separate evidence review on
3400:  vitamin D supplementation found an increase in the incidence of
3440:  kidney stones with combined vitamin D and calcium supplementati
3480: on. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that vitamin D 
34c0: supplementation offers no net benefit in the reduction of falls.
3500: </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understand
3540: ing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Muscle weakness, gait disturbances, and imba
3580: lance are important factors that contribute to increased risk fo
35c0: r falls in older persons. Exercise and physical therapy may impr
3600: ove strength and balance and therefore may result in fewer falls
3640: . Many interrelated variables affect the health status of older 
3680: adults, some of which probably have additive effects and may exp
36c0: lain why multifactorial risk assessment with comprehensive manag
3700: ement is effective in preventing falls. Vitamin D receptors have
3740:  been identified in various cell types, including skeletal muscl
3780: e, and stimulation of these receptors promotes protein synthesis
37c0: .<sup>26, 27</sup> Although it has been previously demonstrated 
3800: that vitamin D or its metabolites may have a beneficial effect o
3840: n muscle strength and balance,<sup>28</sup> the current evidence
3880:  shows no benefit in preventing falls. In addition, the Institut
38c0: e of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) concluded t
3900: hat there may be a potential U-shaped relationship between 25-hy
3940: droxyvitamin D serum levels and health outcomes, with serum leve
3980: ls greater than 125 nmol/L being associated with worse health ou
39c0: tcomes.<sup>29</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</
3a00: h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement w
3a40: as posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from Septembe
3a80: r 26, 2017, to October 24, 2017. In response to public comment, 
3ac0: the USPSTF clarified that physical therapy, which was described 
3b00: separately from exercise interventions in the 2012 recommendatio
3b40: n, is now included among &ldquo;exercise interventions&rdquo; in
3b80:  the current recommendation. Additionally, the USPSTF clarified 
3bc0: that these recommendations apply to older adults not known to be
3c00:  vitamin D deficient. The USPSTF added findings on additional ou
3c40: tcomes, such as quality of life, as well. A few comments request
3c80: ed additional details about effective exercise and multifactoria
3cc0: l interventions. Given the heterogeneity of included interventio
3d00: ns, it is difficult for the USPSTF to identify specific componen
3d40: ts that it found to be particularly effective; however, the USPS
3d80: TF included results from some exploratory analyses. A few commen
3dc0: ts also requested a recommendation on other interventions, such 
3e00: as reducing medication prescriptions and comprehensive eye exami
3e40: nation. The USPSTF can only recommend the use of an intervention
3e80:  when it finds adequate evidence that the benefits outweigh the 
3ec0: harms. Although the USPSTF may have reviewed additional interven
3f00: tions, it did not find adequate evidence to issue a recommendati
3f40: on on all of the reviewed interventions. Interventions that targ

13c0: I or stroke) and without increased bleeding risk (for example, h
1400: istory of GI ulcers, recent bleeding, or use of medications that
1440:  increase bleeding risk).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Assessment of the Balan
1480: ce of Benefits and Harms</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The magnitude of the hea
14c0: lth benefits of aspirin use depends on an individual&rsquo;s bas
1500: eline CVD risk and willingness to take aspirin for a sufficient 
1540: duration to obtain the benefit of reduced incidence of CRC. The 
1580: magnitude of harms depends on the presence of risk factors for b
15c0: leeding.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Baseline CVD Risk</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The mag
1600: nitude of the cardiovascular risk reduction with aspirin use dep
1640: ends on an individual&rsquo;s initial risk for CVD events. Risk 
1680: assessment for CVD should include ascertainment of the following
16c0:  risk factors: age, sex, race/ethnicity, total cholesterol level
1700: , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, systolic blood pre
1740: ssure, hypertension treatment, diabetes, and smoking. An online 
1780: version of the ACC/AHA risk calculator can be found at <a href=\
17c0: "http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/\">http://tools.acc.o
1800: rg/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>CRC Prevention</h4>
1840: \r\n\r\n<p>Colorectal cancer prevention plays an important role 
1880: in the overall health benefit of aspirin, but this benefit is no
18c0: t apparent until 10 years after aspirin therapy is started. Pati
1900: ents need to take aspirin for at least 5 to 10 years to realize 
1940: this potential benefit,<sup>6, 7</sup> and persons with shorter 
1980: life expectancy are less likely to benefit. Thus, aspirin use is
19c0:  more likely to have an effect when it is started between the ag
1a00: es of 50 and 59 years. Because of the time required before a red
1a40: uced incidence in CRC is seen, older persons (that is, 60 years 
1a80: or older) are less likely to realize this benefit than adults ag
1ac0: ed 50 to 59 years.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>GI and Intracrania
1b00: l Bleeding</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence shows that risk for GI bleedi
1b40: ng, with and without aspirin use, increases with age. For this r
1b80: ecommendation, the USPSTF considered older age and male sex to b
1bc0: e important risk factors for GI bleeding. Other risk factors inc
1c00: lude upper GI tract pain, GI ulcers, concurrent anticoagulation 
1c40: or NSAID use, and uncontrolled hypertension.<sup>4, 5</sup> Nons
1c80: teroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy combined with aspirin us
1cc0: e increases the risk for serious GI bleeding compared with aspir
1d00: in use alone.<sup>9</sup> The rate of serious bleeding among asp
1d40: irin users is about 2 to 3 times greater in patients with a hist
1d80: ory of GI ulcer.<sup>10</sup> The risk for serious GI bleeding i
1dc0: s 2 times greater in men than in women.<sup>10</sup> These risk 
1e00: factors increase the risk for bleeding substantially and should 
1e40: be considered in the overall decision about whether to start or 
1e80: continue aspirin therapy. There is no evidence that enteric-coat
1ec0: ed or buffered formulations reduce the risk for serious GI bleed
1f00: ing.<sup>2, 4, 11</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Balance of Benefits and H
1f40: arms</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF used a CVD microsimulation model 
1f80: to estimate cardiovascular event rates based on baseline risk fa
1fc0: ctors and aspirin use. It used the AHA/ACC risk calculator to st
2000: ratify findings of benefits and harms by 10-year CVD risk. The U
2040: SPSTF also calculated estimates of CRC incidence and harms of bl
2080: eeding to determine the net balance of benefits and harms across
20c0:  individuals with varying baseline CVD risk.<sup>8, 12</sup></p>
2100: \r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#tab2\">T
2140: able 2</a> present the USPSTF&rsquo;s estimated lifetime number 
2180: of nonfatal MIs, ischemic strokes, and cases of CRC prevented, s
21c0: tratified by 10-year CVD risk level, age, and sex, among adults 
2200: aged 50 to 69 years (the age range with evidence of net benefit 
2240: from aspirin use). In addition, <a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a> an
2280: d <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a> present the USPSTF&rsquo;s estim
22c0: ated lifetime number of GI bleeding events and hemorrhagic strok
2300: es. The USPSTF developed these estimates assuming that aspirin u
2340: sers are not taking NSAIDs and do not have other conditions that
2380:  increase risk for GI bleeding. The USPSTF estimated life-years 
23c0: and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved as one part of its
2400:  consideration of the balance of benefits and harms of these dis
2440: parate clinical outcomes (see the Implementation section for mor
2480: e information on interpreting the results in <a href=\"#tab1\">T
24c0: able 1</a> and <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ove
2500: rall, the USPSTF determined that the greatest net benefit to be 
2540: gained is by adults aged 50 to 59 years whose 10-year CVD risk i
2580: s 10% or greater. The USPSTF recommends that persons in this age
25c0:  and risk group start taking aspirin. Adults aged 60 to 69 years
2600:  may also benefit from starting aspirin use, although the net be
2640: nefit is smaller due to the increased risk for GI bleeding and d
2680: ecreased benefit in CRC prevention in this age group.<sup>8</sup
26c0: ></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, the decision about the level of CVD ris
2700: k at which the potential benefits outweigh potential harms is an
2740:  individual one. Some adults may decide that avoiding an MI or a
2780:  stroke is very important and that having a GI bleeding event is
27c0:  not as significant. They may decide to take aspirin at a lower 
2800: CVD risk level than those who are more concerned about GI bleedi
2840: ng. Adults who have a high likelihood of benefit with little pot
2880: ential for harm should be encouraged to consider aspirin use. Co
28c0: nversely, adults who have little potential for benefit or are at
2900:  high risk for GI bleeding should be discouraged from it.</p>\r\
2940: n\r\n<h3>Treatment and Dosage</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The optimal dose of
2980:  aspirin to prevent CVD events is not known. Primary prevention 
29c0: trials have demonstrated benefits with various regimens, includi
2a00: ng doses of 75 and 100 mg per day and 100 and 325 mg every other
2a40:  day. A dose of 75 mg per day seems as effective as higher doses
2a80: . The risk for GI bleeding may increase with the dosage. A pragm
2ac0: atic approach consistent with the evidence is to prescribe 81 mg
2b00:  per day, which is the most commonly prescribed dose in the Unit
2b40: ed States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the optimal timing and frequen
2b80: cy of discussions about aspirin therapy are unknown, a reasonabl
2bc0: e approach may be to assess CVD and bleeding risk factors starti
2c00: ng at age 50 years and periodically thereafter, as well as when 
2c40: CVD and bleeding risk factors are first detected or change.</p>\
2c80: r\n\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statements</
2cc0: h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Evide
2d00: nce from primary prevention trials on the benefits of initiating
2d40:  aspirin use in adults younger than 50 years is limited. The pot
2d80: ential benefit is probably lower than in adults aged 50 to 69 ye
2dc0: ars because the risk for CVD events is lower (only a small perce
2e00: ntage of adults younger than 50 years have a 10-year CVD risk &g
2e40: e;10%).<sup>8</sup> Adults younger than 50 years who have an inc
2e80: reased 10-year CVD risk may gain significant benefit from aspiri
2ec0: n use; how much benefit is uncertain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence on 
2f00: the benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use in older adults
2f40:  is limited. Many adults aged 70 years or older are at increased
2f80:  risk for CVD because of their age. They have a high incidence o
2fc0: f MI and stroke; thus, the potential benefit of aspirin could be
3000:  substantial.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Potential Harms</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The 
3040: relationship between older age and GI bleeding is well-establish
3080: ed; thus, the potential harms for adults older than 70 years are
30c0:  significant. The complexity of risk factors, medication use, an
3100: d concomitant illness make it difficult to assess the balance of
3140:  benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use in this age group.
3180:  In addition, aspirin use in adults older than 70 years results 
31c0: in smaller reductions in the incidence of CRC compared with youn
3200: ger adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearl
3240: y 40% of U.S. adults older than 50 years use aspirin for the pri
3280: mary or secondary prevention of CVD.<sup>5</sup> A study of Nati
32c0: onal Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data assessed how c
3300: ommon aspirin use is for the primary prevention of CVD and wheth
3340: er physicians recommend it or patients start it on their own. Am
3380: ong patients who were eligible for aspirin therapy and were at i
33c0: ncreased CHD risk (&gt;10% 10-year risk), about 41% were told by
3400:  a physician to take aspirin. Among patients aged 65 years or ol
3440: der who were told by a physician to take aspirin, 80% adhered to
3480:  the recommendation.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Useful Resource
34c0: s</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF has made other recommendations on CV
3500: D prevention, including smoking cessation and promoting a health
3540: ful diet and physical activity, as well as screening for carotid
3580:  artery stenosis, CHD, high blood pressure, lipid disorders, obe
35c0: sity, diabetes, and peripheral artery disease. In addition, it h
3600: as made recommendations on screening for CRC. These recommendati
3640: ons are available on the USPSTF Web site (<a href=\"/\">www.uspr

0d00: siderations</h2><h3>Implementation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The decision t
0d40: o start or continue taking aspirin to prevent CVD and CRC is com
0d80: plex, with many important factors for clinicians and patients to
0dc0:  consider. The most favorable balance of benefits and harms invo
0e00: lves benefit for both CVD and CRC prevention and little potentia
0e40: l for harm from bleeding. Persons who either are at low risk for
0e80:  CVD events or have a life expectancy too short to benefit from 
0ec0: a reduced risk for CRC will receive significantly less benefit; 
0f00: thus, the balance of benefits and harms will likely not be favor
0f40: able.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The balance of benefits and harms of aspirin
0f80:  use is contingent on 4 main factors: risk for bleeding, prefere
0fc0: nces about taking aspirin, baseline CVD risk, and age.</p>\r\n\r
1000: \n<ul>\r\n\t<li><em>Risk for bleeding:</em> Aspirin use is likel
1040: y to do more harm than good in persons who are at increased risk
1080:  for GI or intracranial bleeding.</li>\r\n\t<li><em>Preferences 
10c0: about taking aspirin:</em> Persons who place a high value on avo
1100: iding long-term daily medication use are poor candidates for asp
1140: irin use.</li>\r\n\t<li><em>Baseline CVD risk:</em> A CVD risk t
1180: hreshold of 10% should prompt a discussion about aspirin use. Pe
11c0: rsons who are at higher risk will benefit more from aspirin use 
1200: than those who are near the 10% threshold. Although persons who 
1240: are at lower risk may still receive benefit, they are less likel
1280: y to have a favorable balance of benefits and harms.</li>\r\n\t<
12c0: li><em>Age 50 to 59 years:</em> Initiating aspirin in this age g
1300: roup has the largest average net benefit (<a href=\"#tab1\">Tabl
1340: e 1</a> and <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a>). A CVD risk threshold
1380:  of 10% will identify patients for whom the benefits outweigh th
13c0: e harms, provided they are not at increased risk for bleeding an
1400: d are willing to take long-term daily medication. In addition, p
1440: ersons in this age range generally have sufficient life expectan
1480: cy to benefit from a reduced risk for CRC.</li>\r\n\t<li><em>Age
14c0:  60 to 69 years:</em> Adults in this age group with a higher CVD
1500:  risk are most likely to have a favorable balance of benefits an
1540: d harms, and younger adults are more likely to benefit from a re
1580: duced risk for CRC. Adults aged 60 to 69 years who are already t
15c0: aking aspirin as recommended by their clinician should continue 
1600: use unless they develop new risk factors for bleeding. Adults wh
1640: o develop CVD should use aspirin, as directed by their clinician
1680: , to prevent future CVD events.</li>\r\n\t<li><em>Age 70 years o
16c0: r older:</em> The USPSTF was unable to assess the balance of ben
1700: efits and harms of initiating aspirin use in this age group. Adu
1740: lts aged 70 years or older who are currently taking aspirin shou
1780: ld discuss with their clinician whether they should continue.</l
17c0: i>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The time to benefit for CRC (that is, redu
1800: ced CRC incidence and death) and time to harm are important cons
1840: iderations in assessing the benefits and harms of initiating asp
1880: irin use in older adults. The CVD prevention benefit begins with
18c0: in the first 5 years of use and continues as long as aspirin is 
1900: used. The CRC prevention benefit is more complex. It takes at le
1940: ast 5 to 10 years of daily aspirin use to obtain a CRC benefit; 
1980: however, due to a longer latent period, the benefit may take 10 
19c0: to 20 years to appear. Therefore, older adults and those with sh
1a00: orter remaining life expectancy may receive less benefit. Meanwh
1a40: ile, bleeding harms may occur in the short term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><
1a80: a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a> p
1ac0: rovide information to help clinicians understand the balance of 
1b00: benefits and harms of aspirin therapy, especially for adults in 
1b40: their 60s. The magnitude of net benefit is smaller at lower 10-y
1b80: ear CVD risk levels and greater at higher levels. For both men a
1bc0: nd women, CRC benefits tend to be lower at higher CVD risk level
1c00: s due to competing causes of mortality, including death from CVD
1c40: .</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There ar
1c80: e many important research gaps that, if filled, could identify p
1cc0: opulations that may benefit the most from using aspirin to preve
1d00: nt CVD and CRC. Cardiovascular disease prevention in subpopulati

3680: alculator derived from the 2013 ACC/AHA pooled cohort equations 
36c0: to estimate CVD risk thresholds.<sup>3</sup> The USPSTF selected
3700:  this tool because of its broader focus on CVD outcomes (combini

3840: HD death, and fatal or nonfatal stroke. It was derived from part
3880: icipants in 4 community-based cohort studies sponsored by the Na
38c0: tional Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The tool accounts for v
3900: arious CVD outcomes, in contrast to many earlier tools that repo
3940: rt only CHD outcomes. In addition, the cohorts from which it was
3980:  derived allowed for the development of sex- and race-specific e
39c0: quations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF focused its review of the evi
3a00: dence on studies of the primary prevention of CVD. It considered
3a40:  11 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the bene
3a80: fits of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular eve
3ac0: nts.<sup>15-25</sup> Four of these studies were published since 
3b00: the last USPSTF review in 2009.<sup>15-17, 25</sup> The trials h
3b40: ad a total of 118,445 participants; 3 were conducted exclusively
3b80:  in men and 1 exclusively in women. Participants&rsquo; mean age
3bc0: s ranged from 55 to 65 years. Eight trials used an aspirin dose 
3c00: of 100 mg or less daily. Duration of follow-up was between 3 and
3c40:  10 years.<sup>22</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Primary prevention trials 
3c80: consistently demonstrated effectiveness of aspirin in preventing
3cc0:  nonfatal MI and stroke. Pooled analysis of 8 trials of low-dose

0400: trials with more than 10 years of follow-up suggest that a reduc

0840: ed across 10 RCTs of primary CVD prevention.<sup>4</sup> An anal
0880: ysis of 6 RCTs of primary CVD prevention also showed no reductio
08c0: n in total cancer incidence. Other published reports have demons

0b00: medical history and other factors, such as concurrent medication
0b40:  use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found only 1 risk prediction tool
0b80:  for bleeding, based on a systematic review of risk estimates an
0bc0: d incidence of upper GI bleeding and CHD with low-dose aspirin u
0c00: se.<sup>30</sup> The tool presumes a baseline incidence rate of 
0c40: upper GI complications of 1 event per 1000 person-years and is m
0c80: odified for 10-year age ranges starting at age 50 years. The too
0cc0: l uses Framingham sex-specific risk prediction equations for CHD
0d00:  and modifies bleeding risk with use of proton-pump inhibitors o
0d40: r <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> eradication, neither of which has
0d80:  been tested for net benefit as part of a comprehensive preventi
0dc0: on regimen. Two retrospective validation studies were conducted,
0e00:  but data were insufficient to support its use for prospective p
0e40: rediction in a clinical setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To evaluate the r
0e80: isk for GI bleeding, the most common serious harm of aspirin use
0ec0: , the USPSTF considered 7 of the CVD primary prevention trials p
0f00: reviously discussed.<sup>15, 17-19, 21-23</sup> These trials rep
0f40: orted major GI bleeding events, defined as GI bleeding requiring
0f80:  transfusion or hospitalization or leading to death. Aspirin dos
0fc0: e ranged from 50 to 325 mg in all but 1 trial. Duration of use a
1000: nd follow-up ranged from 4 to 10 years. Major GI bleeding increa
1040: sed by 58% in aspirin users (odds ratio [OR], 1.58 [CI, 1.29 to 
1080: 1.95]). Analyses of trials using the range of aspirin doses show
10c0: ed similar results. When all major primary and secondary CVD pre
1100: vention trials were pooled (15 studies), the OR increased furthe
1140: r to 1.65.<sup>4</sup> Cohort studies reported similar bleeding 
1180: risk with aspirin use.<sup>10</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hemorrhagic st
11c0: roke was a rare event; 15.5% of total strokes reported in the tr
1200: ials were hemorrhagic. Across 9 primary CVD prevention trials, t
1240: he rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 2.54 strokes per 1000 person-y
1280: ears in aspirin users and 1.95 strokes per 1000 person-years in 
12c0: nonusers. Pooled analyses of low-dose aspirin trials showed an i
1300: ncreased risk for hemorrhagic stroke (OR, 1.27 [CI, 0.96 to 1.68
1340: ]).<sup>5</sup> Pooled analyses of 9 trials of any dose showed a
1380:  significant 33% increase in hemorrhagic stroke (OR, 1.33 [CI, 1
13c0: .03 to 1.71]).<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Increased harms may res
1400: ult from factors that either increase bleeding risk or enhance t
1440: he bleeding effect of aspirin. An adjusted individual-patient da
1480: ta meta-analysis found that older age (per decade), male sex, an
14c0: d diabetes increased risk for serious bleeding.<sup>31</sup> Smo
1500: king and increased blood pressure were also associated with incr
1540: eased major extracranial bleeding. A large cohort study of rates
1580:  of hospitalization for major bleeding events also suggested tha
15c0: t older age, male sex, and diabetes had effects on increasing bl
1600: eeding risk. Statin and proton-pump inhibitor use may decrease t
1640: he likelihood of hospitalization from a major bleeding event.<su
1680: p>10</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</
16c0: h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF used a microsimulation model to estimat
1700: e the magnitude of net benefit.<sup>8, 12</sup> The model incorp
1740: orated findings from the 3 systematic reviews to inform its para
1780: meters and assumptions. Results were stratified by age decade, s
17c0: ex, and 10-year CVD risk. When combined with primary trial data 
1800: and meta-analyses, the model provides an additional analytic bas
1840: is to assess the balance of benefits and harms of aspirin use. I
1880: n addition to the numbers of nonfatal MIs and ischemic strokes p
18c0: revented, CRC cases prevented, and serious GI bleeding events ca
1900: used by aspirin, the USPSTF also considered net life-years and n
1940: et QALYs gained (or lost) over a lifetime as a result of aspirin
1980:  use (<a href=\"#tab1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 
19c0: 2</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initiating aspirin use during ages 50 to 5
1a00: 9 years and continuing unless contraindicated by an adverse blee
1a40: ding event results in the greatest gain in net life-years (range
1a80: , 219 to 463 life-years in women and 333 to 605 life-years in me
1ac0: n) and net QALYs (range, 621 to 833 QALYs in women and 588 to 83
1b00: 4 QALYs in men). Initiating aspirin use during ages 60 to 69 yea
1b40: rs and continuing unless contraindicated by an adverse bleeding 
1b80: event results in smaller gains in net life-years (range, &minus;
1bc0: 12 to 48 life-years in women and &minus;20 to 116 life-years in 
1c00: men) and net QALYs (range, 284 to 360 QALYs in women and 180 to 
1c40: 318 QALYs in men). The USPSTF chose the 10% 10-year CVD risk thr
1c80: eshold as the point at which the tradeoff of benefits and harms 
1cc0: reaches an adequate level of certainty. The benefits for an indi
1d00: vidual patient may shift above or below the threshold depending 
1d40: on individual risk assessment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF determin
1d80: ed with moderate certainty that the net benefit in life-years an
1dc0: d QALYs gained from aspirin use is moderate in adults aged 50 to
1e00:  59 years. Adults aged 60 to 69 years gain fewer net life-years 
1e40: and QALYs because of the increased harms from bleeding that come
1e80:  with older age and the reduced potential for CRC benefits (that
1ec0:  is, direct reduction in incidence and indirect reduction in mor
1f00: tality), which require at least 10 years to become apparent. The
1f40:  USPSTF concluded with moderate certainty that the net benefit f
1f80: rom aspirin use is small in adults aged 60 to 69 years. In both 
1fc0: age groups, persons with higher CVD risk will have a greater net
2000:  benefit (provided their bleeding risk is not also increased).</

2080: g?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Aspirin is an NSAID. It is one of the most com
20c0: monly used drugs and is used mostly to relieve pain. Over the pa
2100: st 30 years, its platelet and clotting effects have become bette
2140: r understood. Its anticlotting effect is useful for primary and 
2180: secondary prevention of cardiovascular events because it can pot
21c0: entially decrease the accumulation of blood clots that form as t
2200: he result of reduced blood flow at atherosclerotic plaques, ther
2240: eby reducing hypoxic damage to heart and brain tissue.<sup>32</s
2280: up></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aspirin is an irreversible cyclooxygenase (COX
22c0: ) inhibitor. The COX-1 enzyme is responsible for producing the p
2300: rostaglandins that protect the gastric mucosa. Inhibition of the
2340:  COX-1 enzyme leaves the mucosa susceptible to damage and GI ble
2380: eding. This negative effect increases at higher doses of aspirin
23c0: .<sup>33</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mechanisms for inhibition of ad
2400: enoma or CRC development are not yet well-understood. Cyclooxyge
2440: nase-dependent and -independent pathways have been proposed. Cyc
2480: looxygenase-dependent pathways may rely on aspirin&rsquo;s anti-
24c0: inflammatory properties to reduce tumorigenesis.<sup>3</sup></p>
2500: \r\n\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A draft ve
2540: rsion of this recommendation statement was posted for public com
2580: ment on the USPSTF Web site from 15 September 2015 to 12 October
25c0:  2015. Many comments requested clarification about initiating an
2600: d continuing aspirin use, especially for persons in their 60s an
2640: d 70s. The USPSTF added language throughout the recommendation s
2680: tatement to clarify its focus on initiating aspirin use and enha
26c0: nced the Implementation section to provide guidance on continuin
2700: g aspirin use. Several comments asked for clarification on the u
2740: se of aspirin to prevent CRC in persons who are not at increased
2780:  CVD risk. The USPSTF clarified that its recommendation is based
27c0:  on the combined benefit of CVD and CRC reduction, and only at 1
2800: 0-year CVD risk levels of 10% or greater is there certainty that
2840:  the benefits exceed the harms of low-dose aspirin use. Several 
2880: comments found the tables difficult to interpret or asked to inc
28c0: lude additional age and risk levels. The USPSTF considered other
2900:  presentations of the data, but the tables represent the results
2940:  from the decision-analysis model that are most relevant to its 
2980: estimation of net benefits. Therefore, the tables only include t
29c0: he age and sex ranges for which the USPSTF found moderate certai
2a00: nty of small or moderate net benefit. More detailed tables can b

3300: dequate evidence that treatment reduced the incidence of long-te

1700: substantially progress during adolescence. The likelihood of pro
1740: gression in adulthood is small for persons with a spinal curvatu

1cc0: <h3>Importance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Prostate cancer is one of the most
1d00:  common types of cancer that affects men. In the United States, 
1d40: the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is app
1d80: roximately 11%, and the lifetime risk of dying of prostate cance
1dc0: r is 2.5%.<sup>1</sup> Many men with prostate cancer never exper
1e00: ience symptoms and, without screening, would never know they hav
1e40: e the disease. In autopsy studies of men who died of other cause
1e80: s, more than 20% of men aged 50 to 59 years and more than 33% of
1ec0:  men aged 70 to 79 years were found to have prostate cancer.<sup
1f00: >2</sup> In some men, the cancer is more aggressive and leads to
1f40:  death. The median age of death from prostate cancer is 80 years
1f80: , and more than two-thirds of all men who die of prostate cancer
1fc0:  are older than 75 years.<sup>1</sup> African American men have 
2000: an increased lifetime risk of prostate cancer death compared wit
2040: h those of other races/ethnicities (4.2% for African American me
2080: n, 2.9% for Hispanic men, 2.3% for white men, and 2.1% for Asian
20c0:  and Pacific Islander men).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Detection
2100: </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Screening for prostate cancer begins with a test
2140:  that measures the amount of PSA protein in the blood. An elevat
2180: ed PSA level may be caused by prostate cancer but can also be ca
21c0: used by other conditions, including an enlarged prostate (benign
2200:  prostatic hyperplasia) and inflammation of the prostate (prosta
2240: titis). Some men without prostate cancer may therefore have posi
2280: tive screening results (ie, &ldquo;false-positive&rdquo; results
22c0: ). Men with a positive PSA test result may undergo a transrectal
2300:  ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy of the prostate to diagnos
2340: e prostate cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Benefits of Early Detection an
2380: d Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal of screening for prostate ca
23c0: ncer is to identify high-risk, localized prostate cancer that ca
2400: n be successfully treated, thereby preventing the morbidity and

3300: cision about whether to be screened for prostate cancer requires
3340:  that each man incorporate his own values about the potential be

33c0: rocedures, and treatment occur soon after screening takes place.
3400:  Although the potential benefits may occur any time after screen
3440: ing, they generally occur years after treatment, because progres

0400:  490-1929) to prevent 1 man from dying of prostate cancer after 
0440: 13 years. The results varied across the individual ERSPC sites,

0b40:  most immediately beneficial for men with high- and medium-risk

0c00: ome men without prostate cancer will receive positive PSA test r
0c40: esults (ie, &ldquo;false-positive&rdquo; results). The false-pos
0c80: itive rate for the PSA test depends on the PSA threshold used. A
0cc0: mong 5 ERSPC sites that reported the false-positive rate, approx
0d00: imately 1 in 6 men screened at least once had 1 or more false-po
0d40: sitive results, and of the positive results in the first round o

0e00: test result and men were screened every 2 years, more than 45% o
0e40: f men who participated in all screening rounds had a false-posit

0ec0: rial, more than two-thirds of men who underwent a prostate biops
0f00: y because of a positive PSA test result were found not to have p
0f40: rostate cancer.<sup>13</sup> In addition to false-positive resul
0f80: ts, there are other harms associated with screening and subseque

1000: matospermia, and hospitalization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 3 large RCTs
1040:  on screening predominantly included men aged 55 to 69 years. Th
1080: ere is inadequate evidence on starting screening at a younger ag
10c0: e in the average-risk population or to obtain a baseline PSA lev
1100: el. Evidence in men 70 years and older does not support routine 
1140: screening because of the lack of trial evidence of benefit, the 
1180: low likelihood of benefit given the time to realize benefit, and
11c0:  the increased risk of harms from false-positive results, biopsi
1200: es, overdiagnosis, and treatment. Although the evidence does not
1240:  support routine screening in all men older than 70 years, the U
1280: SPSTF recognizes the common use of PSA-based screening in practi
12c0: ce today and understands that some older men will continue to re
1300: quest screening and some clinicians will continue to offer it. M
1340: en older than 70 years who request screening should be aware of 
1380: the reduced likelihood of benefit from screening and the increas
13c0: ed risk of false-positive test results and complications of diag
1400: nosis and treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF considered whether
1440:  there are screening and follow-up approaches that increase the 
1480: potential for benefit while reducing the potential for harms. Va
14c0: riation across sites in randomized trials of screening suggests 
1500: there may be greater mortality benefit from screening every othe
1540: r year compared with longer intervals and from using lower PSA t
1580: hresholds for diagnostic biopsy. Although these approaches may h
15c0: ave increased the potential benefit reported in studies, they al
1600: so resulted in substantially more harms&mdash;more false-positiv
1640: e results, more prostate biopsies, and more cases of overdiagnos
1680: is. This trade-off was also observed in a review of decision ana
16c0: lysis models; screening protocols using lower PSA thresholds (&l
1700: t;4.0 ng/mL) for biopsy and more frequent screening intervals of
1740: fered greater potential reductions in prostate cancer mortality 
1780: but higher rates of overdiagnosis and other harms.<sup>14</sup> 
17c0: The frequency of screening in the ERSCP sites ranged from every 
1800: 2 to 7 years. No ERSPC trial site offered screening more often t
1840: han every 2 years, and many sites screened every 4 years. The PS
1880: A threshold for biopsy in the ERSCP sites ranged from 2.5 to 4 n
18c0: g/mL (except for 10 ng/mL in the earlier years at the Belgium si
1900: te). In the G&ouml;teborg, Sweden, site, which reported the larg
1940: est benefit, the frequency of screening was every 2 years, and t
1980: he threshold for biopsy was 2.5 ng/mL (3.0 ng/mL in the first fe
19c0: w years of the study).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>T
1a00: he potential benefit of screening for prostate cancer is because
1a40:  of treatment. Thus, it is important for men to consider both th
1a80: e potential benefits and harms of treatment (including active su
1ac0: rveillance) as they consider whether to be screened. Men not abl
1b00: e or willing to tolerate treatment should not be screened for pr
1b40: ostate cancer. Because most cases of prostate cancer advance ver
1b80: y slowly, if at all, the 10-year survival rate for screen-detect
1bc0: ed, localized prostate cancer is very high. In a recent major tr
1c00: ial that enrolled more than 1500 men randomized to receive eithe
1c40: r active treatment or active surveillance, the 10-year survival 
1c80: rate in all groups was 99%.<sup>15</sup> The good prognosis for 
1cc0: early-stage prostate cancer makes it difficult to study the effe
1d00: ctiveness of treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multiple treatment options
1d40:  exist for prostate cancer, and new ones are being developed. In
1d80:  current practice, the 3 most common treatment options for men w
1dc0: ith screen-detected, localized prostate cancer are surgical remo
1e00: val of the prostate gland (radical prostatectomy), radiation the
1e40: rapy (external-beam radiation therapy, proton beam therapy, or b
1e80: rachytherapy), and active surveillance. The USPSTF considered av
1ec0: ailable evidence on treatment when evaluating the effectiveness 
1f00: of screening and found that current evidence suggests that treat
1f40: ment of early-stage, screen-detected prostate cancer with radica
1f80: l prostatectomy or radiation therapy likely reduces risk of clin
1fc0: ical progression and metastatic disease and may reduce prostate 
2000: cancer mortality. More details about the effectiveness and adver
2040: se effects of active treatment are provided in the Discussion se
2080: ction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Active surveillance is a treatment approach
20c0:  that seeks to limit the harms of treatment by allowing men with
2100:  apparent low-risk prostate cancer to forego surgery or radiatio
2140: n in favor of ongoing monitoring of their cancer. Although proto
2180: cols vary, active surveillance usually includes regular, repeate
21c0: d PSA testing and often repeated digital rectal examination and 
2200: prostate biopsy, with potential for exposure to repeated harms f
2240: rom biopsies. Men whose cancer is found to be changing are offer
2280: ed definitive treatment with surgery or radiation therapy. Other
22c0:  treatment monitoring strategies for men with low-risk cancer ex
2300: ist (for example, watchful waiting) and also vary in protocol. A
2340: ctive surveillance has become a more common treatment choice in 
2380: the United States over the past several years. In a study assess
23c0: ing community-based urology practice in the United States betwee
2400: n 2010 and 2013, about half of men with low-risk prostate cancer
2440:  were treated with radical prostatectomy. The active surveillanc
2480: e rate, however, increased from about 10% in 2005-2009 to 40.4% 
24c0: in 2010-2013 among men with low-risk prostate cancer.<sup>16</su
2500: p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Active treatment of prostate cancer can result 
2540: in major adverse effects. About 3 in 1000 men die during or soon
2580:  after radical prostatectomy, and about 50 in 1000 men have seri
25c0: ous surgical complications requiring intervention. About 1 in 5 
2600: men who undergo radical prostatectomy develop long-term urinary 
2640: incontinence requiring regular use of pads, and about 2 in 3 men
2680:  experience long-term erectile dysfunction. More than half of me

2840: state cancer than white men (203.5 vs 121.9 cases per 100,000 me
2880: n). African American men are also more than twice as likely as w
28c0: hite men to die of prostate cancer (44.1 vs 19.1 deaths per 100,
2900: 000 men).<sup>1</sup> The higher death rate is attributable in p
2940: art to an earlier age at cancer onset, more advanced cancer stag
2980: e at diagnosis, and higher rates of more aggressive cancer (ie, 
29c0: higher tumor grade). These differences in death from prostate ca
2a00: ncer may also reflect that African American men have lower rates
2a40:  of receiving high-quality care.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Available Eviden
2a80: ce</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF searched for evidence about the pot

2b40: /h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The PLCO trial enrolled 4% African American men,

2c00: al did not record or report any race-specific subgroup informati

2e80:  African American vs other men.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Advising African 
2ec0: American Men</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the available evidence, the
2f00:  USPSTF is not able to make a separate, specific recommendation 
2f40: on PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in African American m
2f80: en. Although it is possible that screening may offer greater ben
2fc0: efits for African American men compared with the general populat
3000: ion, currently no direct evidence demonstrates whether this is t
3040: rue. Screening, and subsequent diagnosis and treatment, has the 
3080: potential to increase exposure to potential harms. Decision anal
30c0: ysis models suggest that given the higher rates of aggressive pr
3100: ostate cancer in African American men, PSA-based screening may p
3140: rovide greater benefit to African American men than the general 
3180: population. These models also suggest a potential mortality bene
31c0: fit for African American men when beginning screening before age
3200:  55 years. The USPSTF believes that a reasonable approach for cl
3240: inicians is to inform African American men about their increased
3280:  risk of developing and dying of prostate cancer as well as the 
32c0: potential benefits and harms of screening so they can make an in
3300: formed, personal decision about whether to be screened. Although
3340:  the USPSTF found inadequate evidence about how benefits may dif
3380: fer for African American men, it recognizes the epidemiologic da
33c0: ta showing that African American men may develop prostate cancer
3400:  at younger ages than average-risk men and understands that some
3440:  African American men and their clinicians will continue to scre
3480: en at younger ages. The USPSTF does not recommend screening for 
34c0: prostate cancer in men, including African American men, older th
3500: an 70 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF strongly encourages resear
3540: ch on screening for and treatment of prostate cancer in African 
3580: American men. It is important to consider both the potential add
35c0: itional benefits and harms to fully understand the value of scre
3600: ening. Studies are needed to confirm that African American men w
3640: ho undergo screening receive similar or greater reductions in pr
3680: ostate cancer mortality compared with men in the general populat
36c0: ion, as well as to explore the optimal screening frequency and w
3700: hether beginning screening before age 55 years provides addition
3740: al benefits in African American men. Studies are also needed to 
3780: better understand strategies to mitigate harms and maximize bene
37c0: fits of screening, diagnostic follow-up, and treatment (includin

0380: -degree relative who had advanced prostate cancer at diagnosis, 
03c0: developed metastatic prostate cancer, or died of prostate cancer
0400:  are probably the most likely to benefit from screening. The USP

04c0: hose with multiple first-degree relatives with prostate cancer, 
0500: about their increased risk of developing cancer as well as the p

1340: STF Recommendation</h2><p>This recommendation replaces the 2012 
1380: USPSTF recommendation<sup>38</sup> on PSA-based screening for pr
13c0: ostate cancer. In 2012, the USPSTF concluded that, although ther
1400: e are potential benefits of screening for prostate cancer, these
1440:  benefits do not outweigh the expected harms enough to recommend
1480:  routine screening (D recommendation). The change in recommendat
14c0: ion grade is based in part on additional evidence that increased
1500:  the USPSTF&rsquo;s certainty about the reductions in risk of dy
1540: ing of prostate cancer and risk of metastatic disease. Longer-te
1580: rm follow-up of the ERSPC trial and from some ERSPC trial sites 
15c0: found that PSA-based screening for prostate cancer prevents 1.28
1600:  men from dying of prostate cancer for every 1000 men screened. 
1640: In addition, a subset of ERSPC trial sites have since reported t
1680: hat screening 1000 men aged 55 to 69 years may prevent approxima
16c0: tely 3 men from developing metastatic prostate cancer. Longer-te
1700: rm, 12.7-year results of the PIVOT trial became available since 
1740: the posting of the draft recommendation statement and are simila
1780: r to the 10-year results. Studies continue to demonstrate the ha
17c0: rms of PSA-based screening, including false-positive results, co
1800: mplications from transrectal prostate biopsies, overdiagnosis (w
1840: hich may occur in 20%-50% of cases of screen-detected cancer, ba
1880: sed on estimates from trial data), psychological harms, and harm
18c0: s of treatment, including urinary incontinence and erectile dysf
1900: unction. The change in recommendation grade further reflects new
1940:  evidence about and increased use of active surveillance of low-
1980: risk prostate cancer, which may reduce the risk of subsequent ha
19c0: rms from screening. This recommendation also clearly identifies 
1a00: African American men and men with a family history of prostate c
1a40: ancer as having higher risk for prostate cancer and provides add
1a80: itional information to help support these men in making informed
1ac0:  decisions about screening. For the C recommendation for men age
1b00: d 55 to 69 years, the USPSTF&rsquo;s intention is to convey that
1b40:  each man&rsquo;s values may shift the balance to a net benefit 
1b80: of screening and to promote the importance of informed decision 
1bc0: making prior to screening. The USPSTF continues to find that the
1c00:  benefits of screening do not outweigh the harms in men 70 years
1c40:  and older and recommends against screening in these men.</p>","

1e00: ecommends screening for men who prioritize screening and have a 
1e40: life expectancy of more than 10 to 15 years. The American Urolog
1e80: ical Association<sup>42</sup> recommends that men aged 55 to 69

30c0: s, including observed differences in how men in the screening an

0580: prostate cancer (Gleason score of 6) with a favorable prognosis.
05c0:  Thus, some men randomized to active surveillance had an interme

0740: rial groups (99%) made any potential differences harder to detec
0780: t. Longer-term follow-up studies may provide important additiona

2cc0: s from decision analysis models, which are consistent with the f
2d00: indings of randomized trials and cohort studies, suggest that mo
2d40: re aggressive screening strategies, particularly those that use 
2d80: a lower PSA threshold for biopsy than generally used in the Unit
2dc0: ed States, provide the greatest potential reduction in death fro
2e00: m prostate cancer. However, these strategies are also associated
2e40:  with more false positives, more biopsies, and higher rates of o
2e80: verdiagnosis.<sup>24</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Options for reducing th
2ec0: e overdiagnosis rate include lowering the age at which to stop s
2f00: creening, extending the interval between screenings, and using h
2f40: igher PSA thresholds for biopsy. However, no strategy completely
2f80:  eliminates overdiagnosis. PSA-based screening for prostate canc
2fc0: er every 2 or 4 years instead of annually appears to provide a g
3000: ood trade-off between a reduction in overdiagnosis and a small r
3040: eduction in mortality benefit.<sup>24</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Decisi
3080: on analysis models confirm the USPSTF&rsquo;s conclusion that th
30c0: e overall benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer is 
3100: sensitive to the values of individual men. The magnitude of net 
3140: benefit of PSA-based screening depends on how each man weighs th
3180: e potential benefits and harms of screening, diagnosis, and trea
31c0: tment. The value a man places on potential benefits and harms ma
3200: y also change over time. It may therefore be useful for clinicia
3240: ns to regularly revisit the decision to screen (or not screen) w
3280: ith their patients (<a href=\"#tab\">Table</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A

3400: draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for pu
3440: blic comment on the USPSTF website from April 11 to May 8, 2017.
3480:  A number of comments suggested that because men are now living 
34c0: longer, they should be screened beyond 70 years of age. However,
3500:  the USPSTF considered other evidence in addition to data on lif
3540: e expectancy when recommending against screening in men older th
3580: an 70 years, including results from large screening trials that 
35c0: did not report a mortality benefit for men older than 70 years a
3600: nd evidence on the increased likelihood of harm from screening, 
3640: diagnostic evaluation, treatment, overdiagnosis, and overtreatme
3680: nt. Several comments requested a recommendation for younger men 
36c0: and for baseline PSA-based screening in men 40 years and older o
3700: r 50 years and older. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that 
3740: screening younger men or performing baseline PSA-based screening
3780:  provides benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several comments asked for clar
37c0: ification about what new evidence led to the change from a D to 
3800: a C grade. The new evidence included longer-term follow-up of th
3840: e ERSPC trial and new data on reductions in risk of metastatic d
3880: isease with screening. Although the added benefit reported from 
38c0: the additional follow-up to 13 years (from 10 years) in the ERSP
3900: C trial increased the number of lives saved from 1.07 to 1.28 (a
3940:  small amount, according to some comments), these results gave t
3980: he USPSTF more confidence that the benefit of screening could be
39c0:  greater over a 20- to 30-year period. Evidence newly considered
3a00:  since the draft recommendation statement was posted for comment
3a40:  includes the CAP trial, evidence on psychological harms, and lo
3a80: nger-term follow-up of the PIVOT trial. This evidence led the US
3ac0: PSTF to continue to conclude that there is a small amount of ben
3b00: efit for some men. The USPSTF recognizes the importance of the p
3b40: otential harms of screening and treatment, including psychologic
3b80: al harms and harms from active surveillance, and has added infor
3bc0: mation about this evidence to the Rationale, Clinical Considerat
3c00: ions, and Discussion sections. New evidence from the recently pu
3c40: blished CAP trial was added. Given the limitations of the CAP tr
3c80: ial, including that it only examined 1-time PSA-based screening 
3cc0: and the small difference between the percentage of men in the co
3d00: ntrol and intervention groups (approximately 10%-15% vs 34%, res
3d40: pectively) who received PSA-based screening, the results of this
3d80:  trial did not change the USPSTF&rsquo;s overall assessment of t
3dc0: he evidence and its recommendation.</p>","topic":"Prostate Cance

0b40: s to result in an increase of such examinations. The potential b
0b80: enefit of behavioral counseling about skin self-examination is u

0d80: s performed by the patient and is noninvasive. Psychosocial harm
0dc0: s, such as anxiety or cancer worry, are possible. If skin self-e
0e00: xamination leads to biopsy, procedural harms such as pain, bleed

0e80: <h4>Current Practice</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The frequency of behavioral

0f40: revention</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task 
0f80: Force recommends child care center&ndash;based, primary and midd
0fc0: le school&ndash;based, and multicomponent community-wide interve
1000: ntions for the prevention of skin cancer.<sup>8</sup> These inte

1080:  policy to increase preventive behaviors (eg, covering up, using
10c0:  shade, or avoiding the sun during peak UV hours) among certain 
1100: populations in specific settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Food and 
1140: Drug Administration (FDA) provides information to help guide pat
1180: ients and clinicians regarding sun protection and the use and ef
11c0: fectiveness of broad-spectrum sunscreen.<sup>9</sup> The FDA has
1200:  determined that broad-spectrum sunscreens with a sun-protection
1240:  factor of 15 or greater, reapplied at least every 2 hours, prot
1280: ect against both UVA and UVB radiation and reduce the risk of sk
12c0: in cancer and early skin aging. The FDA also provides consumer e
1300: ducation materials on the dangers of indoor tanning.<sup>10</sup
1340: ></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Environmental Protection Agency provides a v

1780: f-efficacy, or other factors. Health professionals providing in-
17c0: person counseling included primary care clinicians and health ed
1800: ucators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One trial of an intervention involving ch
1840: ildren 3 years and younger used clinician counseling and print m
1880: aterials for parents promoting child sun protection with sun pro
18c0: tection aids (sunscreen samples and hat).<sup>13</sup> Several t

1c00: ded an interactive web program and tailored text messages on sun
1c40:  protection, as well as appearance-focused print materials. The 
1c80: web program study reported reduced sunburns after the interventi
1cc0: on, which provided information on topics such as indoor tanning,
1d00:  UV radiation exposure and health, skin cancer, sunscreen, and s
1d40: kin examination. Each module took about 10 minutes to complete a

1740: hysical activity due to avoiding the outdoors, and a paradoxical
1780:  increase in sun exposure from a false reassurance of protection
17c0:  from sunscreen use. Sunscreen use can be associated with numero

1840: hotoallergic contact dermatitis. Although vitamin D deficiency i

1c40: \r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The 
1c80: USPSTF determined that behavioral counseling interventions are o
1cc0: f moderate benefit in increasing sun protection behaviors in chi
1d00: ldren, adolescents, and young adults with fair skin types. The l
1d40: ink of behavior change to outcomes is supported by several trial
1d80: s and a substantial body of observational evidence showing that 
1dc0: the strongest connection between UV radiation exposure and skin 
1e00: cancer stems from exposure in childhood and adolescence. Evidenc
1e40: e of a connection between sun exposure in adulthood and melanoma
1e80:  is less robust than in childhood. The USPSTF found adequate evi
1ec0: dence that the harms related to counseling or sun protection beh
1f00: aviors are small. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty t
1f40: hat the net benefit of counseling to decrease UV exposure and re
1f80: duce skin cancer risk is moderate in children, adolescents, and 
1fc0: young adults aged 6 months to 24 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF
2000:  found adequate evidence that behavioral counseling intervention
2040: s result in a small increase in sun protection behaviors in adul
2080: ts older than 24 years. The harms of counseling are small. The U
20c0: SPSTF determined that the evidence supporting a link between dec
2100: reased UV exposure in adulthood and skin cancer risk is adequate
2140: . The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net bene
2180: fit of counseling to decrease UV exposure and reduce skin cancer
21c0:  risk is small in adults older than 24 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 
2200: USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits and harms of co
2240: unseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin canc
2280: er. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is
22c0:  insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of cou
2300: nseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cance

2380: nding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>UV radiation from both solar and artificia
23c0: l sources has been classified as a human carcinogen by national 
2400: and international organizations. Epidemiologic evidence suggests
2440:  that the effect of UV radiation exposure from typical doses of 
2480: sunlight varies over the life span, with some evidence of a wind
24c0: ow of biological vulnerability in childhood and adolescence that
2500:  translates into increased skin cancer risk later in life. Much 
2540: of the available evidence concerns the most common skin lesions,
2580:  nonmalignant neoplasia and basal cell and squamous cell cancer.
25c0:  It remains unclear whether the same mechanisms apply to melanom
2600: a risk. For all 3 types of cancer, increasing intermittent or re
2640: creational sun exposure and total sun exposure are linked to inc
2680: reased risk. Artificial UV radiation, specifically indoor tannin
26c0: g, is also associated with an increased risk of skin cancer. Ind
2700: oor tanning before age 35 years, for more than 10 tanning sessio
2740: ns over a lifetime, and for longer than 1 year have been linked 
2780: to increased cancer risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comm

0280: omment on the USPSTF website from January 16, 2018, to February 
02c0: 12, 2018. Several comments expressed concern that the USPSTF did
0300:  not issue a separate positive recommendation for persons at hig
0340: her risk of developing PAD. This population would include older 
0380: adults and patients with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cho
03c0: lesterol levels, and current tobacco use. The USPSTF found the e
0400: vidence addressing screening for PAD in high-risk, asymptomatic 
0440: populations to be limited, with no compelling evidence to suppor

0680:  to clarify this point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comments also raised conce

0780: c minorities and low-socioeconomic populations, and noted that t
07c0: he I statement could discourage testing and perpetuate dispariti
0800: es in treatment and outcomes. The USPSTF recognizes these well-e
0840: stablished disparities in care. However, the evidence on screeni
0880: ng and treatment in these groups is currently lacking, and the U
08c0: SPSTF was unable to determine the overall balance of benefits an

1ac0: rcent to 15% of falls result in fractures,<sup>6</sup> and nearl
1b00: y all hip fractures are related to a fall.<sup>7</sup> Other ris
1b40: ks factors for low bone mass and fractures include female sex, s
1b80: moking, use of glucocorticoids, and use of other medications tha
1bc0: t impair bone metabolism (eg, aromatase inhibitors).<sup>8-11</s

1c40: stimated 74% of all fractures that occur in women are among thos
1c80: e 65 years or older.<sup>6</sup> Although the risk for fractures
1cc0:  in premenopausal women increases with lower peak bone mass, abs
1d00: olute fracture risk in premenopausal women is very low compared 
1d40: with that in postmenopausal women.<sup>12</sup> Although fractur

1e00: </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The large Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative (
1e40: WHI) trial (n=36,282), which studied daily supplementation with 
1e80: 400 IU of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) and 1000 mg of
1ec0:  calcium, reported no significant reduction in any fracture outc
1f00: ome;<sup>14</sup> thus, the USPSTF concluded that supplementatio
1f40: n with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calciu
1f80: m does not prevent fractures. Studies of supplementation with hi
1fc0: gher doses of vitamin D and calcium (alone or combined) showed i
2000: nconsistent results and were frequently underpowered to detect d
2040: ifferences; thus, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence on supp

2100: \n\r\n<p>The WHI trial found a statistically significant increas

21c0: very 273 women who received supplementation over a 7-year follow

2380: upplementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a separate recommendation state
23c0: ment,<sup>18</sup> the USPSTF found that vitamin D supplementati
2400: on does not reduce the number of falls or the number of persons 
2440: who experience a fall. A single study suggested that an annual h
2480: igh dose of vitamin D (500,000 IU) may even be associated with a

27c0:  Approaches to Prevention</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF recommends s
2800: creening for osteoporosis in women 65 years or older and in youn
2840: ger women at increased risk.<sup>21</sup> The USPSTF concludes t
2880: hat the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance o
28c0: f benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in as
2900: ymptomatic adults.<sup>22</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF recentl
2940: y updated its recommendation on interventions to prevent falls i
2980: n community-dwelling older adults.<sup>18</sup> The USPSTF asses
29c0: sed the effect of vitamin D to prevent falls in older adults at 
2a00: average and increased risk for falls without vitamin D insuffici
2a40: ency or deficiency. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that vita
2a80: min D supplementation does not prevent falls. The USPSTF also fo
2ac0: und that exercise can prevent falls in community-dwelling older 
2b00: adults at increased risk for falls; multifactorial interventions
2b40:  may also be effective in some persons as well.<sup>18, 19</sup>

21c0: >The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to estimate the benefits o
2200: f vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation to prevent fra
2240: ctures in community-dwelling men and premenopausal women. The US
2280: PSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to estimate t
22c0: he net benefit of vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementatio
2300: n to prevent fractures in community-dwelling men and premenopaus
2340: al women. Because of the lack of effect on fracture incidence an
2380: d the increased incidence of kidney stones in intervention group
23c0: s, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that daily suppl
2400: ementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less 
2440: of calcium has no net benefit for the primary prevention of frac
2480: tures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. Although wome
24c0: n enrolled in the WHI trial were predominately white, the lower 
2500: risk for fractures in nonwhite women makes it very unlikely that
2540:  a benefit would exist in this population. The USPSTF found inad
2580: equate evidence on calcium supplementation alone, as well as on 
25c0: supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and 
2600: greater than 1000 mg of calcium in postmenopausal women. The USP
2640: STF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to estimate th
2680: e net benefit of supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU 
26c0: of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium in postmenopaus
2700: al women.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological U
2740: nderstanding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Calcium contributes to bone growth,
2780:  and vitamin D helps bones absorb calcium. Normal, healthy bones
27c0:  turn over calcium constantly, replacing calcium loss with new c
2800: alcium. The human body has 2 main sources of vitamin D. Cholecal
2840: ciferol (vitamin D<sub>3</sub>), the larger source of vitamin D,
2880:  is synthesized in the skin by UVB rays from the sun. Vitamin D<
28c0: sub>3</sub> is converted to its active form through enzymatic pr
2900: ocesses in the liver and kidney. Ergocalciferol (vitamin D<sub>2
2940: </sub>) is consumed in the diet and can be found naturally in a 
2980: few foods, such as mushrooms and egg yolks, but is more commonly
29c0:  consumed as a supplement or in fortified foods and beverages, s
2a00: uch as milk, yogurt, and orange juice.<sup>35</sup> Most cells c
2a40: ontain specific receptors for the active form of vitamin D. Stim
2a80: ulation of skeletal muscle receptors promotes protein synthesis,
2ac0:  and vitamin D has a beneficial effect on muscle strength and ba
2b00: lance. Vitamin D controls calcium absorption in the small intest
2b40: ines, interacts with parathyroid hormone to help maintain calciu
2b80: m homeostasis between the blood and bones, and is essential for 
2bc0: bone growth and maintaining bone density. Obtaining insufficient
2c00:  amounts of vitamin D through diet or sun exposure can lead to i
2c40: nadequate levels of the hormone calcitriol (the active form of v
2c80: itamin D), which in turn can lead to impaired absorption of diet
2cc0: ary calcium. Consequently, the body uses calcium from skeletal s
2d00: tores, which can weaken existing bones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The curren
2d40: t recommendation against supplementation with 400 IU or less of 
2d80: vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevent
2dc0: ion of fractures is primarily based on the finding of no benefit
2e00:  with supplementation at lower doses. More evidence is needed to
2e40:  determine whether higher doses of supplementation may be more e
2e80: ffective at preventing fractures. Although the risk for kidney s
2ec0: tones could theoretically increase at higher doses of supplement
2f00: ation, the overall determination of net benefit or net harm will
2f40:  depend on whether a benefit in fracture prevention is also foun
2f80: d at higher doses and, if so, what the magnitude of that benefit
2fc0:  is.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A 
3000: draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for pu
3040: blic comment on the USPSTF website from September 26, 2017, to O
3080: ctober 24, 2017. To clarify which population the recommendation 
30c0: applies to, the USPSTF revised the title to &ldquo;Vitamin D, Ca
3100: lcium, or Combined Supplementation for the Primary Prevention of
3140:  Fractures in Community-Dwelling Adults.&rdquo; Some comments ex
3180: pressed concern that the recommendation against supplementation 
31c0: with vitamin D would be misinterpreted by persons with known ost
3200: eoporosis or vitamin D deficiency. Persons with known osteoporos
3240: is or vitamin D deficiency were excluded from the evidence revie
3280: w, and thus are excluded from the recommendation statement, as d
32c0: escribed in the &ldquo;Summary of Recommendations and Evidence&r
3300: dquo; and &ldquo;Patient Population Under Consideration&rdquo; s
3340: ections. Other comments requested clarification of the role of v
3380: itamin D in persons with known osteoporosis or vitamin D deficie
33c0: ncy. This is beyond the scope of the recommendation and has been
3400:  clarified in the &ldquo;Scope of Review&rdquo; section. Some co
3440: mments also expressed confusion over why a finding of &ldquo;ins
3480: ufficient evidence&rdquo; was issued for supplementation at high
34c0: er doses if the USPSTF recommends against supplementation at low
3500: er doses. The recommendation against supplementation at lower do
3540: ses was based on an overall assessment that supplementation at l
3580: ow doses provides no benefit. Evidence on the effect of suppleme
35c0: ntation on fractures at higher doses is conflicting, with some s
3600: tudies showing a reduction in certain fracture types at higher d
3640: oses, and others showing no reduction or even an increase. More 
3680: studies are needed to more clearly determine if supplementation 
36c0: with vitamin D, calcium, or both consistently prevents fractures
3700: . If future evidence shows a benefit, the magnitude of that bene
3740: fit will need to be weighed against the magnitude of harms cause
3780: d by supplementation (kidney stones).</p>","topic":"Vitamin D, C

11c0: on&#39;s risk of a CVD event. Several calculators and models are
1200:  available to quantify a person&#39;s 10-year risk of CVD events
1240: . The Framingham Risk Score,<sup>5</sup> based on data from the 
1280: Framingham Heart Study, was one of the first widely used CVD ris
12c0: k assessment tools. Persons with a 10-year CVD event risk greate
1300: r than 20% are generally considered high risk, those with a 10-y
1340: ear CVD event risk less than 10% are considered low risk, and th
1380: ose with a 10-year CVD event risk of 10% to 20% are considered i
13c0: ntermediate risk. The Pooled Cohort Equations, introduced by the
1400:  American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association i
1440: n 2013, include the same variables as the Framingham Risk Score 
1480: as well as race/ethnicity and diabetes. Persons with a 10-year C
14c0: VD event risk less than 7.5% are considered at low risk, and tho
1500: se with a 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% or greater are consider

1600: se ECG are used for the diagnostic evaluation of suspected CVD, 
1640: which has led to the suggestion that ECG could also be used to s
1680: creen asymptomatic persons to identify those who would benefit f
16c0: rom earlier, more intensive management of modifiable risk factor
1700: s, preventive interventions, or both. Resting ECG records cardia
1740: c electrical activity while the patient is at rest, over a short
1780:  period of time. Standard ECG testing is performed with 12 leads
17c0: , although some tests use fewer leads. More recently, ECG leads 
1800: have been built into blood pressure cuffs, smartphones, and othe
1840: r devices. Exercise ECG records cardiac electrical activity duri
1880: ng physical exertion, often at a prespecified intensity level. T
18c0: he most common method of exercise ECG is the treadmill test, but
1900:  other methods, such as those using bicycles and ergometers, hav
1940: e also been used. Both resting and exercise ECG look for markers
1980:  of previous myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, and oth
19c0: er cardiac abnormalities (such as left ventricular hypertrophy, 
1a00: bundle branch block, or arrhythmia) that may be associated with 
1a40: CVD or predict future CVD events.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Treatment and I
1a80: nterventions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Asymptomatic adults at increased ris
1ac0: k of CVD events are usually treated with a combination of diet a
1b00: nd exercise modifications, lipid-lowering medications, aspirin, 
1b40: hypertension management, and interventions to encourage tobacco 
1b80: cessation. Recommendations for diet and exercise modifications, 
1bc0: lipid-lowering medications, and aspirin are based on level of ca
1c00: rdiovascular risk. Recent guidelines also recommend risk stratif
1c40: ication of hypertension treatment;<sup>7</sup> the recommendatio
1c80: n for tobacco cessation applies to all persons regardless of CVD

3a80: ning and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Resting ECG has the potential 
3ac0: for anxiety and labeling; however, the USPSTF was unable to find
3b00:  relevant studies on these harms. Exercise ECG has more potentia
3b40: l for direct harms (eg, triggering a cardiovascular event or mus
3b80: culoskeletal injury), but survey data of symptomatic patients su
3bc0: ggests that these harms are very rare.<sup>30, 31</sup> The prim
3c00: ary concern for both types of ECG screening is the harm of subse
3c40: quent procedures or interventions initiated as a result of scree
3c80: ning (eg, angiography or revascularization procedures). Only 1 s
3cc0: tudy reported harms of subsequent testing (1/12 patients referre
3d00: d for revascularization had a nonfatal myocardial infarction);<s
3d40: up>2</sup> therefore, the USPSTF included a broader range of stu
3d80: dy designs in its evaluation to estimate potential harms.</p>\r\
3dc0: n\r\n<p>Angiography rates after screening with exercise ECG in a
3e00: symptomatic populations are generally less than 3% (range, 0.6% 
3e40: to 13%). The majority of patients undergoing angiography in thes
3e80: e studies did not have angiographically demonstrable coronary ar
3ec0: tery stenosis, but some did undergo revascularization (0.1% to 0
3f00: .5%).<sup>18</sup> Based on large population-based registries th
3f40: at include symptomatic persons, angiography is associated with a
3f80:  serious harm rate of 1.7%, including arrhythmia (0.40%), death 
3fc0: (0.10%), stroke (0.07%), and myocardial infarction (0.0
<= Recv data, 16375 bytes (0x3ff7)

0040: ardial infarction (1.7%), coronary artery dissection (1.3%), ble
0080: eding events within 72 hours (1.3%), vascular complications (0.4
00c0: %), renal failure (0.4%), stroke (0.1%), and death on day of pro
0100: cedure (&lt;0.01%).<sup>18</sup> The USPSTF did not find any rec
0140: ent studies that directly address the potential harms of anxiety
0180:  or labeling.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefi
01c0: t</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For asymptomatic adults at low risk of CVD even
0200: ts (defined as 10-year CVD event risk &lt;10%), it is very unlik
0240: ely that the information from resting or exercise ECG (beyond th
0280: at obtained with conventional CVD risk factors) will result in a
02c0:  change in the patient&#39;s risk category that would lead to a 
0300: change in treatment and ultimately improve health outcomes. Seri
0340: ous possible harms are associated with screening with resting or
0380:  exercise ECG, specifically the potential adverse effects of sub
03c0: sequent invasive testing. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with m
0400: oderate certainty that screening with ECG in asymptomatic adults
0440:  at low risk of CVD events has no net benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For
0480:  asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk of CVD events 
04c0: (defined as a 10-year CVD event risk of 10% to 20% or &gt;20%, r
0500: espectively), there is insufficient evidence to determine the ex
0540: tent to which information from resting or exercise ECG adds to c
0580: urrent CVD risk assessment models (ie, Pooled Cohort Equations) 
05c0: and whether it results in a change in risk management and ultima
0600: tely reduces CVD events. As with low-risk adults, serious possib
0640: le harms are associated with screening with resting or exercise 
0680: ECG in asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk of CVD e
06c0: vents. The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence 
0700: to estimate the net benefit of screening with ECG in asymptomati
0740: c adults at intermediate or high risk of CVD events.</p>\r\n\r\n
0780: <h3>How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\
07c0: n\r\n<p>There is substantial and consistent evidence that identi
0800: fying and treating traditional, modifiable CVD risk factors such
0840:  as high blood pressure, abnormal lipid levels, diabetes, curren
0880: t smoking, physical inactivity, and diet improve cardiovascular 
08c0: outcomes. These risk factors are linked to the biological unders
0900: tanding of the pathophysiology of CVD. Electrocardiography measu
0940: res the electrical activity in the heart and results can be abno
0980: rmal for many reasons, only some of which are attributable to at
09c0: herosclerotic CVD. In low-risk patients, these abnormalities are
0a00:  unlikely to result from atherosclerotic CVD; in intermediate- a
0a40: nd high-risk patients, they are more likely to result from ather
0a80: osclerotic CVD, but there is no evidence that targeting these ab
0ac0: normalities in addition to modifiable risk factors has benefit.<

0680: hat the recommendation be expanded to include associated mood di
06c0: sorders (such as anxiety disorder). The primary focus of the USP
0700: STF recommendation and evidence review was depression. Several a
0740: dditional outcomes (including anxiety) were included in the scop
0780: e of the evidence review; however, reporting on incidence or sym
07c0: ptoms of anxiety was limited and inconsistent. Several comments 
0800: questioned why perinatal depression screening tools such as the 
0840: EPDS were not recommended as risk-assessment tools. Additionally
0880: , comments requested that the USPSTF clarify the population at r
08c0: isk that would benefit from counseling interventions. The focus 
0900: of this recommendation is the prevention of depression; the USPS
0940: TF has a separate recommendation on screening for depression in 
0980: all adults, including pregnant women. The Research Gaps and Need
09c0: s section calls for more studies on the use of tools for risk as

2b00:  Woman Abuse Screening Tool (WAST).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HARK includes 
2b40: 4 questions that assess emotional and physical IPV in the past y
2b80: ear. HITS includes 4 items that assess the frequency of IPV, and
2bc0:  E-HITS includes an additional question to assess the frequency 
2c00: of sexual violence. PVS includes 3 items that assess physical ab
2c40: use and safety. WAST includes 8 items that assess physical and e
2c80: motional IPV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most studies only included women who
2cc0:  could be separated from their partners during screening, during
2d00:  the intervention, or both, so screening and the intervention co

2d80: ting requirements vary from one jurisdiction to another, with di
2dc0: fferences in definitions, whom and what should be reported, who 
2e00: should report, and to whom. Some states require clinicians (incl

1880:  for unhealthy drug use. However, some factors are associated wi
18c0: th a higher prevalence of unhealthy drug use. These include bein
1900: g aged 18 to 25 years; male sex; having a mental health conditio
1940: n, personality or mood disorder, or nicotine or alcohol dependen
1980: ce; a history of physical or sexual abuse, parental neglect, or 
19c0: other adversity in childhood; or drug or alcohol addiction in a 
1a00: first-degree relative.<sup>1,9</sup> Factors associated with mis
1a40: use of prescription drugs include history of other drug use, men

1b00: a mental health disorder, interpersonal violence, and family his
1b40: tory of substance use.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Tools</
1b80: h3>\r\n<p>Several screening tools that ask questions about drug 
1bc0: use are available for identifying 1 or more classes of unhealthy
1c00:  drug use, the frequency or severity of use, or drug-related hea
1c40: lth, social, or legal consequences that characterize unhealthy u
1c80: se or drug use disorders. Interviewer-administered tools and sel
1cc0: f-administered tools appear to have similar accuracy.<sup>12</su
1d00: p></p>\r\n<p>Primary care practices may consider several factors
1d40:  when selecting screening tools. Brief tools (eg, NIDA [National
1d80:  Institute on Drug Abuse] Quick Screen, which asks 4 questions a
1dc0: bout use of alcohol, tobacco, nonmedical use of prescription dru
1e00: gs, and illegal drugs in the past year) may be more feasible in 
1e40: busy primary care settings, but longer tools (eg, the 8-item ASS
1e80: IST [Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test])
1ec0:  that assess risks associated with unhealthy drug use or comorbi
1f00: d conditions may reveal information signaling the need for promp
1f40: t diagnostic assessment. Tools with questions about nonmedical u
1f80: se of prescription drugs (eg, TAPS [Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescripti
1fc0: on Medication, and Other Substance Use]) may be useful when clin
2000: icians are concerned about prescription misuse. One study report

22c0: rug use disorders is based on the type of drug used, the severit
2300: y of drug use, and the type of use disorder. Many drug use disor
2340: ders are chronic, relapsing conditions, and many persons who sta
2380: rt treatment do not complete treatment.<sup>13</sup> Therefore, 
23c0: treatment must often be repeated to stabilize current drug use, 
2400: reduce relapse, and achieve abstinence or other treatment goals.
2440:  Some patients, such as those who are pregnant, nursing, or cari

25c0: sup> Drug use disorders involving nonopioid drugs, such as canna
2600: bis, stimulants, and some prescription drugs, are generally trea
2640: ted with various psychosocial interventions that usually involve
2680:  multiple sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational
26c0:  interventions, contingency management, relapse prevention, comm
2700: unity reinforcement, family behavioral therapy, 12-step facilita
2740: tion therapy, or other behavioral approaches. Intensive interven
2780: tions usually involve several in-person sessions over several we
27c0: eks or months.</p>\r\n<p>The management of patients who screen p
2800: ositive is usually accompanied by other interventions, including
2840:  testing for blood-borne pathogens; assessment of misuse of, abu

2f00: tional survey in 2018, 8% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years rep
2f40: orted drug use in the last month. Among youth reporting such dru
2f80: g use, the most commonly used substances were marijuana, inhalan
2fc0: ts, prescription psychotherapeutic drugs, opioids, and hallucino
3000: gens.<sup>1</sup> An estimated 2.7% met diagnostic criteria for 
3040: drug dependence or abuse,<sup>1</sup> and the vast majority pres
3080: ented with concurrent mental health diagnoses.<sup>25</sup> Risk
30c0:  factors for drug use in youth include aggressive childhood beha

3140: o drugs at school, and community poverty.<sup>26</sup></p>\r\n<p
3180: >Adolescent substance use, including use of heroin and misuse of
31c0:  prescription opioids, is associated with the leading causes of 
3200: death&mdash;suicide, overdose, unintentional injury, and violenc
3240: e in adolescents and young adulthood.<sup>25</sup> Substance use
3280:  during this period of rapid brain development can also harm neu
32c0: rocognitive development and endocrine function that, in turn, ca
3300: n impair academic, occupational, and social functioning.<sup>26-
3340: 28</sup> Adolescents with drug use disorders are also at increas
3380: ed risk of sexually transmitted infections, other physical healt

3b00:  clarified that &ldquo;screening&rdquo; means asking questions a
3b40: bout unhealthy drug use (not testing biological specimens, such 
3b80: as blood or urine testing) and that the term &ldquo;unhealthy dr
3bc0: ug use&rdquo; is used to describe nonmedical use of prescription
3c00:  or nonprescription drugs, illegal drugs, or unregulated substan
3c40: ces (other than alcohol or tobacco). A few comments requested mo
3c80: re information about the USPSTF&rsquo;s interpretation of the ev
3cc0: idence. The USPSTF clarified in the Rationale section that scree
3d00: ning in primary care settings for drug use can detect a spectrum
3d40:  of drug use and types of drug use. The USPSTF, therefore, consi
3d80: dered evidence from treatment trials that may have included pati
3dc0: ents with more severe drug use disorders to be applicable to scr
3e00: eening. Some comments noted that screening adults may have unint
3e40: ended harms, such as discouraging health care seeking in persons
3e80:  who do not want to be screened, medical and sociolegal conseque
3ec0: nces of reporting positive screening results, privacy issues, or
3f00:  diverting clinicians&rsquo; attention from patients with establ
3f40: ished drug use disorders. The USPSTF recognizes these as potenti
3f80: al harms and provided more details on screening implementation c
3fc0: onsiderations that may address these harms. In addition

06c0: e. Consistent use of condoms decreases risk of HIV acquisition b

10c0: ign=\"left\">Implementation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first step in imp
1100: lementing PrEP is identifying persons at high risk of HIV acquis
1140: ition who may benefit from PrEP. However, identifying persons at
1180:  risk of HIV can be challenging because of stigma and discrimina
11c0: tion against gay, bisexual, transgender, and nonbinary persons, 
1200: or the lack of a trusting relationship between the patient and c
1240: linician. It is important that clinicians routinely take a sexua
1280: l and injection drug use history for all their patients in an op
12c0: en and nonjudgmental manner. If a person is identified as potent
1300: ially belonging to a high-risk group, then further discussion ca
1340: n identify behaviors that may make that person an appropriate ca
1380: ndidate for PrEP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CDC provides a complete disc
13c0: ussion of implementation considerations for PrEP, including base
1400: line and follow-up testing and monitoring, time to achieving pro
1440: tection, and discontinuing PrEP.<sup>3</sup> A few particularly 
1480: important points regarding the provision of PrEP are outlined be
14c0: low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before prescribing PrEP, clinicians should ex
1500: clude persons with acute or chronic HIV infection through taking
1540:  a medical history and HIV testing. The 2-drug antiretroviral re
1580: gimen used in PrEP, when used alone, is not an effective treatme
15c0: nt for HIV infection, and its use in persons living with HIV can
1600:  lead to the emergence of, or selection for, drug-resistant HIV 
1640: infection. It is also generally recommended that kidney function
1680:  testing, serologic testing for hepatitis B and C virus, testing
16c0:  for other STIs, and pregnancy testing (when appropriate) be con
1700: ducted at the time of or just before initiating PrEP. Ongoing fo
1740: llow-up and monitoring, including HIV testing every 3 months, is
1780:  also suggested. The time from initiation of PrEP to achieving p
17c0: rotection against HIV infection is unknown. Pharmacokinetic data
1800:  suggest that maximum levels of tenofovir diphosphate (the activ
1840: e form of tenofovir) is reached in 7 days in rectal tissue and i
1880: n 20 days in blood (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and vagi
18c0: nal tissue.<sup>3</sup> Patients can continue PrEP as long as hi
1900: gh risk of HIV acquisition continues. Patients may discontinue P
1940: rEP for several reasons, including personal preference, decrease
1980: d risk of HIV acquisition, or adverse medication effects.</p>\r\
19c0: n\r\n<p>PrEP does not reduce the risk of other STIs. Consistent 
1a00: use of condoms decreases risk of HIV acquisition by approximatel
1a40: y 80%<sup>5 </sup>and reduces the risk of other STIs. Promoting 
1a80: consistent condom use is an important component of a successful 
1ac0: PrEP program. The CDC also recommends regular screening for STIs
1b00:  in men who have sex with men who are at high risk of STIs, and 
1b40: testing in anyone with signs or symptoms.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\
1b80: n<p>Clinical trials demonstrate a strong connection between adhe
1bc0: rence to PrEP and its effectiveness in preventing HIV acquisitio
1c00: n. Reduced adherence is associated with marked declines in effec
1c40: tiveness. Therefore, adherence support is a key component of pro
1c80: viding PrEP. Components of adherence support include establishin
1cc0: g trust and open communication with patients, patient education,
1d00:  reminder systems for taking medication, and attention to medica
1d40: tion adverse effects and having a plan to address them. Addition
1d80: al information on adherence support is available from the CDC gu
1dc0: idelines.<sup>3,22</sup> Adherence support is especially importa
1e00: nt in populations shown to have lower adherence to PrEP, such as
1e40:  young persons and racial/ethnic minorities.<sup>25-27</sup></p>
1e80: \r\n\r\n<p>It is important for clinicians to recognize that barr
1ec0: iers to the implementation and uptake of PrEP exist. These barri
1f00: ers can include structural barriers, such as lack of health insu
1f40: rance, and other factors, such as an individual&rsquo;s willingn
1f80: ess to believe that he or she is an appropriate candidate for Pr
1fc0: EP or to take PrEP. There are also racial/ethnic disparities in 
2000: the use of PrEP. One study reported that although black/African 
2040: American persons account for an estimated 44% of all new HIV inf
2080: ections in the United States, only 10.1% of those who initiated 
20c0: PrEP from 2012 to 2015 were black/African American. Similarly, b
2100: lack women, who are also disproportionately affected by HIV, wer
2140: e more than 4 times less likely to have initiated PrEP than whit
2180: e women.<sup>28</sup> These barriers and disparities need to be 
21c0: addressed to achieve the full benefit of PrEP.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 al

22c0: If an affected family member with a <em>BRCA</em>-related cancer

23c0:  known mutations or from ancestry groups in which certain mutati
2400: ons are more common (eg, Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations) can
2440:  be tested for these specific mutations. Because risk assessment

2c80: justify a change in the grade of the recommendation. In its deli

06c0: pe of Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To update its 2004 recommendation on
0700:  screening for pancreatic cancer, the USPSTF commissioned a syst
0740: ematic review on the benefits and harms of screening for pancrea
0780: tic cancer, the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests for pancr
07c0: eatic cancer, and the benefits and harms of treatment of screen-
0800: detected or asymptomatic pancreatic cancer.<sup>12,13</sup> The 
0840: USPSTF considered studies of screening in persons at high risk o
0880: f pancreatic cancer due to familial history to determine whether
08c0:  this evidence might help inform its recommendation on screening
0900:  for pancreatic cancer in the general population.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3
0940: >Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no 
0980: studies that reported on the sensitivity or specificity of CT sc
09c0: an, MRI, or EUS as screening tests for pancreatic cancer.</p>\r\
0a00: n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found 13 cohort studies of screening for panc
0a40: reatic cancer, mostly in persons at high familial risk, using CT
0a80:  scan, MRI, or EUS (n...=...1317) that reported on the yield of 
0ac0: screening.<sup>14-26</sup> One study also included screening in 
0b00: a group of 161 participants who did not have known familial or g
0b40: enetic risks and detected no cases of pancreatic cancer in this 
0b80: group.<sup>22</sup> Among high-risk participants in all studies,
0bc0:  a total of 18 cases of pancreatic cancer were found across all 
0c00: rounds of screening, for a yield of 15.6 cases per 1000 persons.
0c40: <sup>12,13</sup> The applicability of these data to persons not 
0c80: at high risk of pancreatic cancer is uncertain, and the yield of
0cc0:  screening in a population with a lower incidence of pancreatic 
0d00: cancer is likely to be much lower. Another important considerati
0d40: on is that any screening test used in a population with a lower 
0d80: incidence of pancreatic cancer would potentially have a lower po
0dc0: sitive predictive value and a higher rate of false-positive resu
0e00: lts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatme
0e40: nt</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no studies on the benefits of
0e80:  screening for pancreatic cancer or on the benefits of treatment
0ec0:  of screen-detected or asymptomatic pancreatic cancer in the gen
0f00: eral population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 13 cohort studies of scree
0f40: ning in persons at high familial risk, a total of 57 screened pa
0f80: tients underwent pancreatic surgery. Of the 57 patients undergoi
0fc0: ng surgery, 14 were found to have pancreatic cancer, 38 had prec
1000: ursor lesions (intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, pancreat
1040: ic intraepithelial neoplasia, or both), and 5 had neuroendocrine
1080:  tumors, liver hyperplasia, or a benign serous cystadenoma.<sup>
10c0: 12</sup> Because the risk of progression of precursor lesions (p
1100: articularly low-grade lesions) to invasive cancer is not clear, 
1140: the balance of the potential benefits or harms of detecting and 
1180: undergoing pancreatic surgery to remove such lesions is unknown.
11c0:  Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is common, and most cases 
1200: do not progress to cancer. In 2 studies, 26% to 54% of pancreata
1240:  removed at surgery for reasons other than pancreatic cancer con
1280: tained such lesions.<sup>27,28</sup> Another retrospective study
12c0: , describing the experience at 3 US cancer centers with surgical
1300:  resection of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms,<sup>29</
1340: sup> found that the International Consensus Guidelines criteria 
1380: for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms o
13c0: f the pancreas<sup>30</sup> had high sensitivity (98.4%) but low
1400:  specificity (14.8%) to predict high-grade dysplasia or invasive
1440:  cancer. These data suggest the possibility that screening in th
1480: e general population might lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatme
14c0: nt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the screening studies of high-risk persons,
1500:  a total of 18 cases of pancreatic cancer were detected. As note
1540: d above, 14 of these cases were confirmed by surgery. The remain
1580: ing 4 cases were detected with advanced-stage nonresectable dise
15c0: ase. Twelve of the cases (66.7%) were detected at stage I or II 
1600: or were classified as &ldquo;resectable.&rdquo;<sup>12,13</sup>&
1640: nbsp;Of the 18 detected cases of pancreatic cancer, longer-term 
1680: follow-up was reported for only 10. Among those 10 cases, 5 pers
16c0: ons were alive at 12 to 63 months of follow-up, 2 of whom were r
1700: eported to have distant metastases.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;These data
1740:  are limited by incomplete reporting of follow-up for detected c
1780: ases and by the small number of cases. The USPSTF did not find s
17c0: tudies that compared health outcomes for screened and unscreened
1800:  populations to determine the effectiveness of screening. In add
1840: ition, the applicability of these results to a population not at
1880:  high risk is uncertain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Potential Harms of Early

2500: ruary 5 through March 4, 2019. In response to public comment, th

19c0: rior recommendation. Given the established benefits and practice
1a00:  of screening for syphilis in pregnant women, the USPSTF targete
1a40: d its evidence review to the direct benefits of screening on the
1a80:  prevention of congenital syphilis morbidity and mortality and t
1ac0: he harms of screening for and treatment of syphilis infection in
1b00:  pregnant women.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Benefits of Early
1b40:  Detection and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPSTF found no new 
1b80: evidence inconsistent with the benefits of screening for syphili
1bc0: s infection in pregnant women. Evidence from observational studi
1c00: es demonstrates fewer adverse pregnancy outcomes among pregnant 
1c40: women screened and treated for syphilis infection compared with 
1c80: pregnant women not treated. In particular, treatment appears to 
1cc0: be more beneficial when provided earlier rather than later in pr
1d00: egnancy.<sup>16</sup> A 2014 systematic review of 54 observation
1d40: al studies found that incidence of congenital syphilis, preterm 
1d80: birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal death was dram
1dc0: atically reduced in women treated for syphilis during pregnancy 
1e00: compared with women who had untreated syphilis.<sup>20</sup> How
1e40: ever, only a slight reduction in stillbirth or fetal loss was ob
1e80: served in women who were only treated in the third trimester, co
1ec0: mpared with women who had untreated syphilis. Extended follow-up
1f00:  of a study previously considered by the USPSTF for its 2009 rec
1f40: ommendation<sup>3</sup> reported on the effects of implementing 
1f80: a free syphilis screening and treatment program for all pregnant
1fc0:  women living in Shenzhen, China, from 2002 to 2012 (n...=...2,4
2000: 41,237).<sup>21</sup> During follow-up, screening uptake increas
2040: ed from 89.8% to 97.2%, and the congenital syphilis case rate de
2080: creased from 109.3 to 9.4 cases per 100,000 live births. During 
20c0: the same time, the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes decre
2100: ased from 42.7% to 19.2%, and the incidence of stillbirth or fet
2140: al loss decreased from 19.0% to 3.3%. The USPSTF found this evid
2180: ence to be consistent with findings from its previous evidence r
21c0: eview.<sup>22</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Potential Harm
2200: s of Screening and Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Potential harms of s
2240: creening for and treatment of syphilis infection include false-p

22c0: xiety to the patient, and harms of antibiotic medication use.<su
2300: p>16</sup> Consistent with previous reviews, the current, target
2340: ed review identified 5 studies that reported on false-positive r
2380: ates of various screening tests<sup>23-27</sup> and 1 study that
23c0:  reported on false-negative RPR test results.<sup>28</sup> Overa
2400: ll, these studies demonstrate that false-positive results with c
2440: hemiluminescence or enzyme-linked immunoassay in pregnant women 
2480: are common (false-positive rates ranged from 0% to 88.2%)<sup>23
24c0: -27</sup> and that false-negative RPR test results can result fr
2500: om undiluted serum with high titers (known as the prozone effect
2540: ).<sup>28</sup> Because of the high potential for false-positive
2580:  results with individual tests, a 2-step screening algorithm is 
25c0: recommended. The USPSTF found no studies that reported on the fa
2600: lse-positive rate of the traditional or reverse sequence screeni
2640: ng algorithm in pregnant women. Harms of treatment include rare 
2680: adverse drug-related effects, such as anaphylaxis attributable t
26c0: o penicillin allergy and the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (febril
2700: e reaction with headache, myalgia, and other symptoms), which ma
2740: y occur within the first 24 hours after any type of syphilis the
2780: rapy. The USPSTF found no studies that reported on harms to the 
27c0: fetus from treatment of syphilis infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align

2840: e USPSTF considered the evidence using a reaffirmation process a

1200: ed a separate recommendation statement on interventions for toba
1240: cco use cessation in adults 18 years and older, including pregna
1280: nt persons.<sup>16</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Definitions</h3>\r\n<p>&ldqu
12c0: o;Tobacco use&rdquo; refers to use of any tobacco product. As de
1300: fined by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), tobacco prod
1340: ucts include any product made or derived from tobacco intended f
1380: or human consumption (except products that meet the definition o
13c0: f drugs), including, but not limited to, cigarettes, cigars (inc
1400: luding cigarillos and little cigars), dissolvable tobacco, hooka
1440: h tobacco, nicotine gels, pipe tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, s
1480: mokeless tobacco products (including dip, snuff, snus, and chewi
14c0: ng tobacco), vapes, e-cigarettes, hookah pens, and other electro
1500: nic nicotine delivery systems. &ldquo;Smoking&rdquo; generally r
1540: efers to the inhaling and exhaling of smoke produced by combusti
1580: ble tobacco products such as cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. &ldq
15c0: uo;Vaping&rdquo; refers to the inhaling and exhaling of aerosols
1600:  produced by e-cigarettes.<sup>17</sup> Vape products usually co
1640: ntain nicotine, which is the addictive ingredient in tobacco. Su
1680: bstances other than tobacco can also be used to smoke or vape.</
16c0: p>\r\n<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>All youth are considered
1700:  at risk of initiating tobacco use. Interventions to prevent the
1740:  initiation of tobacco use should be provided to all youth who h
1780: ave not started using tobacco products yet, regardless of the pr
17c0: esence or absence of other risk factors. The following risk fact
1800: ors may increase the risk of tobacco use in youth: being male, w
1840: hite race, not college-bound, from a rural area, having parents 
1880: with lower levels of education, parental smoking, having childho
18c0: od friends who smoke, being an older adolescent, experiencing hi
1900: ghly stressful events, and perceiving tobacco use as low risk.<s
1940: up>18,19</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Interventions to Prevent Tobacco Use a
1980: nd Implementation Considerations</h3>\r\n<p>Various behavioral c
19c0: ounseling intervention types are effective in preventing tobacco
1a00:  initiation in children, including face-to-face counseling, tele
1a40: phone counseling, and computer-based and print-based interventio
1a80: ns.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<p>Individual interventions target speci
1ac0: fic audiences (the child/adolescent, the parent, or both) and a 
1b00: variety of age ranges. For example, in the reviewed studies,<sup
1b40: >14</sup> interventions for children aged 7 to 10 years tended t
1b80: o be print-based materials, whereas face-to-face counseling and 
1bc0: telephone- and computer-based interventions typically targeted c
1c00: hildren older than 10 years. Interventions targeting parents ten
1c40: ded to be print- or telephone-based. The number of contacts made
1c80:  with intervention recipients also varied, ranging from 1 to 8 c
1cc0: ontacts.<sup>14</sup> The intensity of the interventions varied,
1d00:  with the content of the print materials ranging from stickers t
1d40: o informational newsletters or an activity book (for children) o
1d80: r activity guide (for parents). For telephone-based intervention
1dc0: s, telephone counseling was usually provided in conjunction with
1e00:  another modality such as print materials or face-to-face counse
1e40: ling. Based on the evidence reviewed,<sup>14</sup> no specific c
1e80: omponent of behavioral counseling interventions (such as interve
1ec0: ntion modality, target audience, duration of intervention, or in
1f00: tervention setting) appeared to make an intervention more or les
1f40: s effective. Thus, clinicians have a broad range of effective be
1f80: havioral counseling interventions from which to choose. For addi
1fc0: tional information about behavioral counseling interventions to 
2000: prevent tobacco use, see <a href=\"#tab2\">Table 2</a>, the Addi
2040: tional Tools and Resources section, and the <a href=\"#box\">Box
2080: </a>.</p>\r\n<p>Most of the evidence on behavioral counseling in
20c0: terventions to prevent tobacco use focused on prevention of ciga
2100: rette smoking.<sup>14</sup> Given the similar contextual and cul
2140: tural issues currently surrounding the use of e-cigarettes in yo
2180: uth and the inclusion of e-cigarettes as a tobacco product by th
21c0: e FDA, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence on interventions t
2200: o prevent cigarette smoking could be applied to prevention of e-
2240: cigarette use as well. The USPSTF also concludes that the eviden
2280: ce could be applied to prevention of cigar use, which includes c
22c0: igarillos and little cigars.</p>\r\n<h3>Additional Tools and Res

2480: regnant women,<sup>16</sup> and primary care behavioral interven

2540: for Practice Regarding the I Statement on Cessation</h3>\r\n<h4>
2580: Potential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Nearly 90% of adult dail
25c0: y smokers smoked their first cigarette by age 18 years.<sup>1</s
2600: up> In 2019, an estimated 1.43 million high school and middle sc
2640: hool students reported current use of cigars, 1.15 million high 
2680: school and middle school students reported current use of conven
26c0: tional cigarettes, and 5.38 million high school and middle schoo
2700: l students reported current use of e-cigarettes.<sup>7</sup> Of 
2740: high school and middle school students who used any tobacco prod
2780: uct in the past 12 months, 57.5% reported that they had at least
27c0:  1 quit attempt;<sup>7</sup> however, most quit attempts fail, a
2800: nd about 80% will go on to smoke into adulthood.<sup>36</sup> Im
2840: mediate adverse health effects in child and adolescent cigarette
2880:  smokers include increased negative respiratory effects such as 
28c0: impaired lung growth, early onset of lung function decline, resp
2900: iratory and asthma-related symptoms (eg, coughing and wheezing),
2940:  and early abdominal aortic atherosclerosis.<sup>1,36</sup> Conc
2980: erns regarding use of e-cigarettes in adolescence includes nicot
29c0: ine dependence and toxicity, harm to the developing brain, its u
2a00: se as a bridge to conventional cigarette smoking, and inhalation
2a40:  of carcinogens.<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n<p>Although the evidence on 
2a80: behavioral counseling interventions to prevent tobacco use in ch
2ac0: ildren and adolescents is robust, fewer studies with smaller sam
2b00: ple sizes are available that evaluate the effect of behavioral c
2b40: ounseling interventions or pharmacotherapy on tobacco cessation.
2b80: <sup>14</sup> The pooled effect of the trials that evaluated beh
2bc0: avioral counseling interventions for tobacco cessation in primar
2c00: y care settings did not find a significant reduction in smokers 
2c40: after the intervention.<sup>14</sup> However, the study interven
2c80: tions were heterogeneous and most of the studies were small, mak
2cc0: ing it difficult to determine whether interventions were unsucce
2d00: ssful at helping children and adolescents to stop using tobacco,
2d40:  or whether they were underpowered to detect a difference in tob
2d80: acco cessation.</p>\r\n<p>No medications are currently approved 
2dc0: by the FDA for tobacco cessation in children and adolescents. Th
2e00: e label for varenicline now states that it is not indicated in c
2e40: hildren and adolescents 16 years and younger because its efficac
2e80: y in this population has not been demonstrated.<sup>37</sup> Few
2ec0:  trials have been published on medication use for tobacco cessat
2f00: ion in children and adolescents (1 trial on nicotine replacement
2f40:  therapy [NRT] and 2 trials on bupropion sustained-release [SR])
2f80: . Trials were relatively small, and all included behavioral coun
2fc0: seling in addition to pharmacotherapy. None found a significant 
3000: difference in quit rates at the end of treatment.<sup>14</sup> O
3040: ne additional published trial on varenicline for cessation was i
3080: dentified; however, it was not considered in the USPSTF evidence
30c0:  review because the trial included young adults and the mean age
3100:  of participants was older than the age in the inclusion criteri

3240: found no evidence on harms from behavioral counseling interventi
3280: ons for tobacco cessation;<sup>14</sup> however, these harms are
32c0:  likely small to none based on the absence of reported harms in 
3300: the evidence, the noninvasive nature of the interventions, and t
3340: he low likelihood of serious harms.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found t
3380: he evidence on harms from medications for tobacco cessation in c
33c0: hildren and adolescents to be inadequate. None of the published 
3400: trials reported any serious harms; however, study sizes were rel
3440: atively small.<sup>14</sup> The single trial of NRT found a grea
3480: ter number of headaches, cough, abnormal dreams, muscle pain, an
34c0: d patch-related adverse events with NRT.<sup>38</sup> Bupropion 
3500: carries a boxed warning for increased risk of suicidality in chi
3540: ldren, adolescents, and young adults, with other concerns for in
3580: creased risk of seizure, hypertension, mania, visual problems, a
35c0: nd unusual thoughts and behaviors.<sup>39</sup> Varenicline is n
3600: ot indicated in children 16 years and younger; therefore, no war
3640: nings specific to this age group are included in its label.<sup>
3680: 37</sup> For older populations, labeling includes warnings and p
36c0: recautions for neuropsychiatric adverse events, including suicid
3700: ality, seizures, interaction with alcohol, cardiovascular events
3740: , sleepwalking, angioedema, serious skin reactions, and nausea.<

37c0: y one-third to one-half of children and adolescents who have vis
3800: ited a clinician in the past year were asked about their tobacco
3840:  use.<sup>40,41</sup> Of those who reported tobacco use in the p
3880: ast 30 days, approximately one-fourth were advised to quit.<sup>
38c0: 40,41</sup></p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2>
3900: <p>This recommendation replaces the 2013 USPSTF recommendation o
3940: n primary care interventions to prevent tobacco use in children 
3980: and adolescents.<sup>42</sup> It is consistent with the 2013 rec
39c0: ommendation, which similarly issued a B recommendation for prima
3a00: ry care clinicians to provide interventions to prevent initiatio
3a40: n of tobacco use among children and adolescents. New to the curr
3a80: ent recommendation is the inclusion of e-cigarettes as a tobacco
3ac0:  product. Also new to the current recommendation is the I statem
3b00: ent on insufficient evidence on interventions for cessation of t
3b40: obacco use among this population. The USPSTF is calling for more
3b80:  research to identify interventions (behavioral counseling or ph
3bc0: armacotherapy) to help children and adolescents who use tobacco

0680: USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>14,15</sup> to evalu
06c0: ate the benefits and harms of primary care interventions for tob
0700: acco use prevention and cessation in children and adolescents. T
0740: he current systematic review newly included e-cigarettes as a to
0780: bacco product.</p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Primary Care Interventions
07c0: </h3>\r\n<p>Nearly all studies evaluated the effect of intervent
0800: ions on smoking prevention and cessation. As mentioned previousl
0840: y, the USPSTF determined that this evidence could be applied to 
0880: other forms of tobacco use, including e-cigarette use.</p>\r\n<h
08c0: 3>Prevention</h3>\r\n<p>Fourteen trials (n...=...25,049) reporte
0900: d on the effects of behavioral counseling interventions to preve
0940: nt the initiation of smoking.<sup>14</sup> Nine of these trials 
0980: enrolled only children who were nonsmokers at baseline, while 5 
09c0: trials enrolled both smokers and nonsmokers but reported results
0a00:  by baseline smoking status. The weighted mean age of participan
0a40: ts was 12.8 years, although eligible ages ranged from 7 to 19 ye
0a80: ars across studies.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<p>Most studies used int
0ac0: erventions that targeted the child/adolescent, although some tar
0b00: geted both children and parents/caregivers and a few targeted on
0b40: ly the parents/caregivers. Intervention content included health 
0b80: education, readiness to act or change, and parenting skills (com
0bc0: munication and positive parenting). Delivery settings of interve
0c00: ntions varied and included primary care clinics, dental clinics,
0c40:  schools (after hours), and the child&rsquo;s home. Various type
0c80: s of interventions were used, including print materials, face-to
0cc0: -face counseling, telephone support, and computer-based interven
0d00: tions. Six of the studies used only a single intervention type, 
0d40: and 8 studies used combinations of various interventions (eg, te
0d80: lephone counseling plus print materials or face-to-face counseli
0dc0: ng plus a computer-based intervention). Most studies reported th
0e00: at fewer youth initiated smoking when they received a behavioral

10c0: eported on the effects of behavioral counseling interventions on
1100:  smoking cessation in youth; 6 trials had fewer than 65 particip
1140: ants analyzed per intervention group.<sup>14</sup> Four trials e
1180: nrolled only smokers, while 5 trials enrolled both smokers and n
11c0: onsmokers but reported results by baseline smoking status.<sup>1
1200: 4</sup> The weighted mean average age of participants in cessati
1240: on trials was much older than in the prevention trials (16.6 yea

12c0: rventions targeted the child/adolescent and very few targeted pa
1300: rents/caregivers. Intervention content most commonly focused on 
1340: assessing and facilitating the youth&rsquo;s readiness to change
1380: ; a few interventions included health education. The delivery se
13c0: tting of interventions was most commonly a primary care or denta
1400: l clinic; a few studies delivered interventions at home. Nearly 
1440: all interventions used combinations of intervention types, most 
1480: commonly face-to face counseling; telephone- and computer-based 
14c0: interventions and print materials (1 intervention) were used les
1500: s commonly. Two trials reported significant increases in smoking
1540:  cessation rates in youth receiving interventions.<sup>21,43</su
1580: p> One trial used a combination of motivational interviewing sup
15c0: plemented with handouts, a computer program, and telephone calls
1600: ;<sup>21</sup> the other trial used a combination of 1 face-to-f
1640: ace session supplemented with 1 telephone call.<sup>43</sup> Met
1680: a-analysis of all 9 trials reported a risk reduction of percent 
16c0: smokers after the intervention that was not statistically signif
1700: icant (relative risk, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.93-1.01]); 80.6% of partic
1740: ipants in the intervention groups were still smoking at the end 
1780: of the study (range, 6-18 months), vs 84.1% in the control group
17c0: s.<sup>14</sup> However, given the small study sizes, it was unc
1800: lear whether this finding was a result of the studies being unde
1840: rpowered to detect a change in smoking behavior. Additional anal
1880: yses were performed to evaluate if various factors, such as inte
18c0: rvention type, setting, target population (child vs parent), or 
1900: study duration may modify whether an intervention was effective.

1a00: p>14</sup> Two trials evaluated bupropion SR<sup>44,45</sup> and
1a40:  1 trial evaluated NRT.<sup>46</sup> All trials were relatively 
1a80: small (211 to 312 participants per trial), and all trials also i
1ac0: ncluded behavioral counseling interventions in addition to medic
1b00: ations. One of the bupropion SR trials also included NRT for all
1b40:  participants.<sup>44</sup> None of the trials reported that med
1b80: ications improved cessation rates; smoking rates remained high i
1bc0: n both the treatment and the control groups in all trials. In th
1c00: e bupropion SR trials, 87.5% to 93.8% of participants were still
1c40:  smoking at the 6-month follow-up;<sup>44,45</sup> 95.6% of the 
1c80: NRT group and 93.4% of the control group were still smoking at 1
1cc0: 2 months in the NRT trial.<sup>46</sup> The USPSTF also identifi
1d00: ed 1 published trial of varenicline for tobacco cessation in old
1d40: er adolescents and young adults<sup>47</sup> and 1 unpublished t
1d80: rial of varenicline for tobacco cessation in adolescents.<sup>48
1dc0: ,49</sup> Results from these trials were not considered by the U
1e00: SPSTF because of the older age of participants<sup>47</sup> and 
1e40: because the study results were not published in a peer-reviewed 
1e80: journal.<sup>48,49</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Harms of Primary Care Interv
1ec0: entions</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF evaluated harms of behavioral coun
1f00: seling interventions from the 18 trials that reported on benefit
1f40: s of interventions on smoking prevention and smoking cessation, 
1f80: as well as 4 additional trials that reported on the effect of be
1fc0: havioral counseling interventions on smoking prevalence irrespec
2000: tive of baseline smoking status.<sup>14</sup> None of the 22 tri
2040: als reported adverse events or harms associated with behavioral 
2080: counseling interventions.<sup>14</sup> Some trials reported high
20c0: er smoking rates at follow-up in intervention groups compared wi
2100: th control groups, but this finding was not statistically signif
2140: icant in any of the trials.</p>\r\n<p>The USPSTF evaluated harms
2180:  of medications for smoking cessation from 4 trials (n...=...914
21c0: );<sup>14</sup> the 3 trials described above (2 of bupropion and
2200:  1 of NRT), as well as a fourth trial of bupropion SR that did n
2240: ot meet inclusion criteria for evidence on benefits because its 
2280: follow-up was less than 6 months.<sup>50</sup> No difference in 
22c0: serious or severe adverse events was reported with bupropion vs 
2300: control groups, although 2 trials reported that 4% of participan
2340: ts withdrew because of adverse events with bupropion.<sup>14</su
2380: p> Some studies reported more headaches, cough, dream disturbanc
23c0: e, insomnia, and irritability with bupropion than the control gr
2400: oup.<sup>14</sup> Although no cases were reported in the studies
2440:  included in the current review, bupropion carries a boxed warni
2480: ng for increased risk of suicidality in children, adolescents, a
24c0: nd young adults, and the insert also includes other concerns for
2500:  increased risk of seizure, hypertension, mania, visual problems
2540: , and unusual thoughts and behaviors.<sup>39</sup> In the single
2580:  NRT trial, NRT was associated with more headaches, cough, abnor
25c0: mal dreams, muscle pain, and patch-related adverse events than p
2600: lacebo.<sup>38</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</h3>\
2640: r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was poste
2680: d for public comment on the USPSTF website from June 25 to July 
26c0: 22, 2019. Several comments requested that the USPSTF recommend b
2700: ehavioral counseling interventions for tobacco cessation in yout
2740: h, given the known harms of tobacco use in youth and the lack of
2780:  proven harms from counseling interventions. The USPSTF only rec
27c0: ommends a preventive service when there is at least adequate evi
2800: dence that there is a net benefit to providing the service; abse
2840: nce of harms from a service is not sufficient evidence for the U
2880: SPSTF to recommend a preventive service. However, as with all fi
28c0: ndings of insufficient evidence, the USPSTF calls for more resea
2900: rch on identifying ways to help youth who use tobacco to quit. T
2940: he USPSTF has also clarified in its Practice Considerations sect
2980: ion that given the finding of insufficient evidence, health care
29c0:  practitioners should determine if offering behavioral counselin
2a00: g for tobacco cessation to certain individuals is reasonable. Ot
2a40: her comments requested clarification about which tobacco product
2a80: s the USPSTF recommendation addresses. The USPSTF clarified this
2ac0:  in the USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net Benefit section. A
2b00: dditional changes made to the recommendation statement in respon
2b40: se to public comment include clarification of which population t
2b80: he recommendation applies to (see the Practice Considerations se
2bc0: ction), use of the term &ldquo;e-cigarettes&rdquo; instead of &l

3300: 2><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that pe
3340: diatricians provide brief counseling to all children and adolesc
3380: ents to prevent tobacco use initiation, and that all teenagers b
33c0: e screened for tobacco and nicotine use. For adolescents who wan
3400: t to stop using tobacco, it recommends that tobacco dependence t
3440: reatment, referral, or both be offered, and that tobacco depende
3480: nce pharmacotherapy can be considered for adolescents who are mo
34c0: derately to severely dependent on tobacco who want to stop smoki
3500: ng. e-Cigarettes are not recommended as a treatment for tobacco 
3540: dependence.<sup>51</sup> The AAP also recommends that pediatrici
3580: ans screen children and adolescents, parents, and caregivers for
35c0:  e-cigarette use, and provide prevention counseling for children
3600:  and adolescents. Further, it recommends that parents, caregiver
3640: s, and adolescents who use e-cigarettes should be offered or ref

36c0: ependence pharmacotherapy appropriate to their level of addictio
3700: n and readiness to change and, again, that e-cigarettes are not 
3740: recommended as a treatment for tobacco dependence. Last, the AAP
3780:  recommends addressing parent and caregiver tobacco dependence a

3800: Surgeon General, smoking cessation is beneficial at any age,<sup
3840: >53</sup> tobacco prevention efforts must focus on both adolesce
3880: nts and young adults,<sup>36</sup> and health care professionals

2040: otential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Dementia affects an estim
2080: ated 2.4 to 5.5 million persons in the United States, and its pr
20c0: evalence increases with age. Dementia affects an estimated 9.9% 
2100: of persons aged 75 to 84 years and 29.3% of those 85 years or ol
2140: der.<sup>2</sup> Subjective memory issues are common in adults, 
2180: with studies showing that approximately 50%<sup>18</sup> to 75%<
21c0: sup>19</sup> of adults have at least minor concerns about their 
2200: memory.</p>\r\n<p>Although there is insufficient evidence to rec
2240: ommend for or against screening for cognitive impairment, there 
2280: may be important reasons to identify cognitive impairment early.
22c0:  Burdens of cognitive impairment include direct effects on the p
2300: atient (eg, loss of function and relationships, financial misjud
2340: gments, and nonadherence with recommended therapies), direct eff
2380: ects on caregivers (eg, burden and depression), and effects on s
23c0: ociety (eg, costs of care). Early detection of cognitive impairm
2400: ent can allow for identification and treatment of reversible cau
2440: ses, may help clinicians anticipate problems patients may have i
2480: n understanding and adhering to medical treatment plans, and may
24c0:  also be useful by providing a basis for advance planning on the
2500:  part of patients and families. Clinicians should remain alert t
2540: o early signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment (eg, problems

2640: left\">Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Evidence about the harms of sc
2680: reening is limited. One potential harm is labeling a person with
26c0:  an illness that is typically progressive and for which treatmen

2740:  higher stress, greater depression, and lower quality of life in
2780:  persons aware of a diagnosis of cognitive impairment,<sup>20</s
27c0: up> while others have found no such association.<sup>21,22</sup>
2800:  Evidence about the effects of false-positive results is limited
2840: . AChEIs are associated with harms, some of which are serious, i
2880: ncluding central nervous system disturbances, bradycardia, and f
28c0: alls. Evidence about the harms of nonpharmacologic interventions
2900:  is limited, but these harms are assumed to be small.</p>\r\n<h4
2940:  align=\"left\">Current Practice</h4>\r\n<p>Most commonly, evalu
2980: ation for or diagnosis of cognitive impairment occurs as a resul
29c0: t of patient- or caregiver-reported concerns or symptoms, or cli
2a00: nician&rsquo;s suspicion. As many as 29% to 76% of patients with
2a40:  dementia are unrecognized in the primary care setting.<sup>23-2
2a80: 5</sup> In 2011, Medicare added detection of cognitive impairmen

2b40:  function by direct observation; considering information and con

2340:  remain alert to early signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment
2380: . Some comments suggested additional studies that should be cons

0500: pplies to asymptomatic adults 50 years or older. However, the ra
0540: ndomized trial evidence focuses almost entirely on men aged 65 t
0580: o 75 years. In this Recommendation Statement, the recommendation

0600: lthough the net benefit estimates are driven by biologic sex (ie
0640: , male/female) rather than gender identity. Persons should consi
0680: der their sex at birth to determine which recommendation best ap
06c0: plies to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Assessment of Risk<
0700: /h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Important risk factors for AAA include older age,
0740:  male sex, smoking, and having a first-degree relative with an A
0780: AA.<sup>13-16</sup> Other risk factors include a history of othe
07c0: r vascular aneurysms, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular d
0800: isease, atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension.
0840: <sup>17-19</sup> Factors associated with a reduced risk include 
0880: African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, Asian ethnicity, and 
08c0: diabetes.<sup>13,20-24</sup> Risk factors for AAA rupture includ
0900: e older age, female sex, smoking, and elevated blood pressure.<s
0940: up>1</sup> Clinicians should consider the presence of comorbid c
0980: onditions and not offering screening if patients are unable to u
09c0: ndergo surgical intervention or have a reduced life expectancy.<
0a00: /p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"left\">Smoking Status</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Epid
0a40: emiologic literature commonly defines an &ldquo;ever smoker&rdqu
0a80: o; as someone who has smoked 100 or more cigarettes. Indirect ev
0ac0: idence shows that smoking is the strongest predictor of AAA prev
0b00: alence, growth, and rupture rates.<sup>1</sup> There is a dose-r
0b40: esponse relationship, as greater smoking exposure is associated 
0b80: with an increased risk for AAA.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 align
0bc0: =\"left\">Family History</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Family history of AAA in
0c00:  a first-degree relative doubles the risk of developing AAA.<sup
0c40: >25</sup> The risk of developing an AAA is stronger with a femal
0c80: e first-degree relative (odds ratio [OR], 4.32) than with a male
0cc0:  first-degree relative (OR, 1.61).<sup>1,25</sup> However, evide
0d00: nce is lacking on whether persons with family history experience
0d40:  a different natural history or surgical outcomes than those wit
0d80: hout such a history.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">S
0dc0: creening Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary method of screening fo
0e00: r AAA is conventional abdominal duplex ultrasonography.<sup>26</
0e40: sup> Screening with ultrasonography is noninvasive, is simple to
0e80:  perform, has high sensitivity (94%-100%) and specificity (98%-1
0ec0: 00%) for detecting AAA,<sup>1,27-31</sup> and does not expose pa
0f00: tients to radiation. Computed tomography is an accurate tool for
0f40:  identifying AAA; however, it is not recommended as a screening 
0f80: method because of the potential for harms from radiation exposur
0fc0: e.<sup>1</sup> Physical examination has been used in practice bu
1000: t has low sensitivity (39%-68%) and specificity (75%) and is not
1040:  recommended for screening.<sup>32</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 align=\"
1080: left\">Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence is adequate t
10c0: o support 1-time screening for men who have ever smoked. All of 
1100: the population-based randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of AAA sc
1140: reening used a 1-time screening approach; 7 fair- to good-qualit
1180: y cohort studies and 1 fair-quality case-control study (n...=...
11c0: 6785) show that AAA-associated mortality over 5 to 12 years is r
1200: are (&lt;3%) in men with initially normal results on ultrasonogr
1240: aphy (defined as an AAA &lt;3 cm in diameter).<sup>1</sup></p>\r
1280: \n\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Treatment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment of A
12c0: AA depends on aneurysm size, the risk of rupture, and the risk o
1300: f operative mortality. Larger size is associated with an increas
1340: ed risk of rupture. The annual risk for rupture is nearly 0% for
1380:  persons with AAAs between 3.0 and 3.9 cm in diameter, 1% for th
13c0: ose with AAAs between 4.0 and 4.9 cm in diameter, and 11% for th
1400: ose with AAAs between 5.0 and 5.9 cm in diameter.<sup>1</sup> Su
1440: rgical repair is standard practice for men with an AAA of 5.5 cm
1480:  or larger in diameter or an AAA larger than 4.0 cm in diameter 
14c0: that has rapidly increased in size (defined as an increase of 1.
1500: 0 cm in diameter over a 1-year period). Endovascular aneurysm re
1540: pair (EVAR) has become the most common approach for elective AAA
1580:  repair. Open repair is a time-tested, effective treatment for A
15c0: AA. In the United States, 80% of intact AAA repairs and 52% of r
1600: uptured AAA repairs are performed using EVAR.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\
1640: n\r\n<p>The majority of screen-detected AAAs (&ge;90%) are betwe
1680: en 3.0 and 5.5 cm in diameter and thus below the usual threshold
16c0:  for surgery. The current standard of care for patients with sta
1700: ble smaller aneurysms is to maintain ultrasound surveillance at 
1740: regular intervals because the risk of rupture is small. Recommen
1780: ded surveillance intervals for monitoring the growth of small AA
17c0: As vary across guideline groups, and adherence with surveillance
1800:  guidelines has been reported to be as low as 65%.<sup>1</sup> R
1840: epairing smaller aneurysms with a lower risk of rupture increase

2b40: r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was poste
2b80: d for public comment on the USPSTF website from April 23 through
2bc0:  May 20, 2019. Commenters requested more information about how t
2c00: he USPSTF assessed older evidence. The USPSTF recognizes that ol
2c40: der studies have certain limitations. However, in reviewing all 
2c80: available evidence on the benefits and harms of treating screen-
2cc0: detected asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women, the USPSTF 
2d00: found the evidence to be adequate. Several comments sought clari
2d40: fication on the USPSTF&rsquo;s rationale for changing the grade 
2d80: of the recommendation from an &ldquo;A&rdquo; to a &ldquo;B&rdqu
2dc0: o; for pregnant persons. A change in grade may occur when eviden
2e00: ce has increased or decreased and results in a change in the cer
2e40: tainty or magnitude of net benefit.<sup>39</sup> Newer evidence,
2e80:  such as the lower prevalence of pyelonephritis and a better und
2ec0: erstanding of the harms associated with antibiotic use, changed 
2f00: the USPSTF&rsquo;s assessment of both the certainty (from high t
2f40: o moderate certainty) and net benefit of screening (from substan
2f80: tial to moderate net benefit), leading to the grade change.</p><
2fc0: h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>The USPSTF identified several 
3000: gaps in the evidence where more research is needed:</p>\r\n\r\n<
3040: ul>\r\n\t<li>There were few studies that examined asymptomatic b
3080: acteriuria and risk of serious outcomes (ie, pyelonephritis or u
30c0: rosepsis) in modern pregnant populations. Epidemiologic evidence
3100:  suggests that the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria has be
3140: en low in recent decades, and many antibiotics used in older stu
3180: dies are no longer recommended for use in pregnancy. More observ
31c0: ational studies examining this would help improve the applicabil
3200: ity of the evidence base.</li>\r\n\t<li>Clinical trials, observa
3240: tional studies, and natural experiments in settings where asympt
3280: omatic bacteriuria screening and treatment are not the standard 
32c0: of care or where guidelines are changing would be useful in asse
3300: ssing benefits and harms.</li>\r\n\t<li>Newer understandings of 
3340: the human microbiome suggest that bacterial colonization may pla
3380: y a protective role in both mothers and babies. For pregnant and
33c0:  nonpregnant populations, research is needed to better understan
3400: d the microbiology of a healthy urinary tract and the natural hi
3440: story of asymptomatic bacteriuria.</li>\r\n\t<li>The role of cur
3480: rent patterns of antibiotic use in the epidemiology of asymptoma
34c0: tic bacteriuria is unclear. Antibiotic use increases the risk of
3500:  antimicrobial resistance and can change the microbiome. More re
3540: search is needed to better understand potential harms of treatme
3580: nt and the effects of antibiotic use on newborn, child, and long

1540: 4 align=\"left\"><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em></h4>\r\n<
1580: p>Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of cardiac arrhyth
15c0: mia, affecting more than 2.7 million individuals in the United S
1600: tates.<sup>1</sup> Atrial fibrillation is strongly associated wi
1640: th older age (eg, prevalence increases from 0.2% among adults &l
1680: t;55 years to 10% among those &ge;85 years) and obesity, both of
16c0:  which are increasing in the United States.<sup>2</sup> Other ri
1700: sk factors include high blood pressure, diabetes, heart failure,
1740:  prior cardiothoracic surgery, current smoking, prior stroke, sl
1780: eep apnea, alcohol and drug use, and hyperthyroidism.</p>\r\n<p>
17c0: Electrocardiography, the intervention considered for this recomm
1800: endation, records the electrical activity of the heart using ele
1840: ctrodes (or leads) placed on the skin. It can be measured with 1
1880: 2 leads, fewer than 12 leads, or a single handheld lead. One sys
18c0: tematic review reported a 93% sensitivity and 97% specificity fo
1900: r 12-lead ECG; individual studies in the review reported sensiti
1940: vity ranging from 68% to 100% and specificity ranging from 76% t
1980: o 100%.<sup>3</sup> In addition, several medical devices (eg, au
19c0: tomatic blood pressure cuffs and pulse oximeters) are being desi
1a00: gned to detect an irregular heartbeat, and an increasing number 
1a40: of consumer devices (eg, wearable monitors and smartphones) have
1a80:  the capability to assess heart rhythm.<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<p>Pu
1ac0: lse palpation and heart auscultation can also detect atrial fibr
1b00: illation. In the systematic review discussed above, pulse palpat
1b40: ion was reported to have relatively good sensitivity (point esti
1b80: mate, 0.87-1.00) but lower specificity than ECG (point estimate,
1bc0:  0.77-0.84) for detecting atrial fibrillation.<sup>3</sup> Howev
1c00: er, to address this lower specificity, confirmatory ECG can be r
1c40: eadily performed in practice in response to an irregular pulse.<
1c80: /p>\r\n<p>Without treatment with anticoagulant therapy, patients
1cc0:  with atrial fibrillation have an approximately 5-fold increased
1d00:  risk of stroke, and strokes associated with atrial fibrillation
1d40:  tend to be more severe than strokes attributed to other causes.
1d80: <sup>5</sup> Approximately one-third of patients with atrial fib
1dc0: rillation who have a stroke die within the year, and up to 30% o
1e00: f survivors have some type of permanent disability.<sup>6</sup> 
1e40: Atrial fibrillation does not always cause noticeable symptoms, a
1e80: nd some persons may not be aware that they have it. For approxim
1ec0: ately 20% of patients who have a stroke associated with atrial f
1f00: ibrillation, stroke is the first sign that they have the conditi
1f40: on.<sup>7</sup> If persons with undiagnosed atrial fibrillation 
1f80: could be detected earlier and start preventive therapy earlier, 
1fc0: some of these strokes might be avoided.</p>\r\n<h4 align=\"left\
2000: "><em>Potential Harms</em></h4>\r\n<p>The performance of ECG its
2040: elf is not associated with significant harm, although abnormal r
2080: esults may cause anxiety. Misinterpretation of ECG results may l
20c0: ead to misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment. Treatment of atri
2100: al fibrillation includes anticoagulant therapy for stroke preven
2140: tion, which is associated with a risk of bleeding, and pharmacol
2180: ogic, surgical, endovascular (eg, ablation), or combined treatme
21c0: nts to control heart rhythm or heart rate. In addition, ECG may 
2200: detect other abnormalities (either true- or false-positive resul
2240: ts) that can lead to invasive confirmatory testing and treatment
2280: s that have the potential for serious harm. For example, angiogr
22c0: aphy and revascularization are associated with risks, including 
2300: bleeding, contrast-induced nephropathy, and allergic reactions t
2340: o the contrast agent.</p>\r\n<h4 align=\"left\"><em>Current Prac
2380: tice</em></h4>\r\n<p>Few data are available on the current preva
23c0: lence of screening for atrial fibrillation with ECG or the frequ
2400: ency with which pulse palpation or heart auscultation are perfor
2440: med in the United States.</p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">Treatment an
2480: d Interventions</h3>\r\n<p>Treatment of atrial fibrillation has 
24c0: 2 components&mdash;managing arrhythmia and preventing stroke. In
2500:  general, these treatment goals are independent of each other, b
2540: ecause even restoring sinus rhythm does not necessarily reduce s
2580: troke risk enough to change how anticoagulant therapy is managed
25c0: , given the potential for subsequent recurrence of atrial fibril
2600: lation. Arrhythmia can be managed by controlling the heart rate 
2640: to minimize symptoms (usually through medication) or by restorin
2680: g a normal rhythm. Methods for restoring normal rhythm include e
26c0: lectrical or pharmacologic cardioversion and surgical or cathete

0640: % of pregnant women, depending on the specific population being 
0680: studied.<sup>1,16</sup> Reported factors that increase the likel

0700: ican race, poverty, smoking, increased body mass index, vaginal 
0740: douching, low educational attainment, and certain sexual behavio
0780: rs, including a high number of partners, lack of condom or contr

0800: rent sexually transmitted infections.<sup>6,15,17,18</sup></p>\r
0840: \n<p>Causes of preterm delivery are likely multifactorial, and n
0880: umerous risk factors are associated with an increased risk for p
08c0: reterm birth.<sup>6</sup> History of a prior preterm delivery is
0900:  associated with a 2.5-fold higher odds for preterm delivery in 
0940: subsequent pregnancies.<sup>19</sup> While bacterial vaginosis d
0980: uring pregnancy is associated with a 2-fold higher odds for pret
09c0: erm delivery,<sup>2</sup> it is not clear that bacterial vaginos

0a40:  for preterm delivery include, but are not limited to, cervical 
0a80: insufficiency, multifetal gestation, young or advanced maternal 
0ac0: age, low maternal body mass index (&lt;20, calculated as weight 
0b00: in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), genitourinary
0b40:  infections, HIV infection, and other maternal medical condition
0b80: s.<sup>6,20-23</sup> The association of these additional risk fa

3200: reported on harms to children from in utero exposure.</p>\r\n<p>
3240: The 8 trials that reported on maternal harms of treatment of bac

3440: on and control groups. Maternal harms of oral clindamycin were r
3480: eported in 2 trials<sup>38,41</sup> (n...=...3345). Only 1 trial
34c0:  reported on serious adverse events and did not observe any in e
3500: ither treatment group. Both studies reported a higher incidence

39c0:  USPSTF found few reported maternal harms and no reported fetal 
3a00: harms in the literature. In addition, use of metronidazole and c
3a40: lindamycin to treat bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has bec

3ac0:  or fetal adverse effects to date.</p>\r\n<h3>Is the Evidence Co
3b00: nsistent With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Causes of pre
3b40: term delivery are likely multifactorial, and the exact mechanism
3b80:  of how some risk factors may lead to preterm delivery is poorly
3bc0:  understood. Epidemiologic data suggest that risk for preterm de
3c00: livery may be higher when asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis is pr
3c40: esent (pooled odds ratio, 2.16 [95% CI, 1.56-3.00]; 32 studies; 
3c80: 30,518 participants).<sup>2</sup> However, the causal pathway of
3cc0:  how bacterial vaginosis may lead to preterm delivery is unclear
3d00: . Earlier theories postulated that bacterial vaginosis may lead 
3d40: to upper genital tract infections, which may in turn contribute 
3d80: to&nbsp; preterm PROM or preterm labor. More recently, it has be
3dc0: en suggested that maternal vaginal mucosal immune response may p
3e00: lay a role in preterm labor or preterm PROM, as well as acquisit
3e40: ion of bacterial vaginosis. Although the evidence is clear that 
3e80: treating asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons no
3ec0: t at increased risk for preterm delivery does not prevent preter
3f00: m delivery, it is still unclear whether treating asymptomatic pr
3f40: egnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery may help p
3f80: revent preterm delivery.</p>\r\n<h3>Response to Public Comment</

0940:  however, intervention studies based on these screening tests in
0980:  asymptomatic women (for preterm delivery) have not demonstrated
09c0:  improved perinatal outcomes, and the American College of Obstet
0a00: ricians and Gynecologists does not recommend the use of these te

3340: nitions related to tobacco use are reported in the <a href=\"#bo
3380: x\">Box</a>. Although tobacco use refers broadly to the use of a
33c0: ny tobacco product, cigarette smoking has historically been the 
3400: most prevalent form of tobacco use in the US, and most of the ev
3440: idence surrounding cessation of tobacco products relates to quit
3480: ting combustible cigarette smoking. Thus, the current USPSTF rec
34c0: ommendations focus on interventions for tobacco smoking cessatio
3500: n. Additionally, although e-cigarettes are considered a tobacco 
3540: product that should also be the focus of tobacco prevention and 
3580: cessation efforts, for this recommendation statement, the eviden

3680: whether or not risk factors for use are present, and encouraged 
36c0: to stop using tobacco. When smoking is identified, all patients 
3700: should be provided interventions to quit smoking. Higher smoking
3740:  prevalence has been observed in men; persons younger than 65 ye

0580: ts (in particular, combining short-acting plus long-acting forms
05c0:  of NRT) has been found to be more effective than using a single
0600:  form of NRT.<sup>13</sup> Based on a smaller number of studies,
0640:  varenicline appears to be more effective than NRT or bupropion 
0680: SR.<sup>13</sup> Information on dosing regimens is available in

0780: counseling interventions.</strong> Providing any psychosocial in
07c0: tervention to pregnant persons who smoke tobacco can increase sm
0800: oking cessation. The behavioral counseling intervention type mos

0940: es about the effects of smoking on both maternal and fetal healt
0980: h and strong advice to quit as soon as possible.<sup>12,13</sup>
09c0:  Although smoking cessation at any point during pregnancy yields

1500: In 2020, the Surgeon General issued a Report on Smoking Cessatio
1540: n.<sup>47</sup> The report&rsquo;s findings were largely similar
1580:  to that of the USPSTF. The Surgeon General&rsquo;s report issue
15c0: d some additional findings regarding internet-based intervention
1600: s for cessation and describes some suggestive but not sufficient
1640:  evidence about specific e-cigarette use behaviors and increased
1680:  cessation. Overall, the Surgeon General&rsquo;s report found th

1880: h4>Pharmacotherapy for Pregnant Persons</h4>\r\n<p>According to 
18c0: data from the National Vital Statistics System, in 2016, 7.2% of
1900:  women who gave birth smoked cigarettes during pregnancy,<sup>6<
1940: /sup> and among 1071 pregnant women aged 18 to 44 years, 3.6% re
1980: ported using e-cigarettes.<sup>48</sup> Smoking during pregnancy
19c0:  reduces fetal growth, increases the risk of preterm birth, and 
1a00: doubles the risk for delivering an infant with low birth weight.
1a40:  It also increases the relative risk for stillbirth death by 25%
1a80:  to 50%.<sup>1,2</sup> Quitting smoking early in pregnancy can r
1ac0: educe or eliminate the adverse effects of smoking on fetal growt
1b00: h.<sup>47</sup> For pregnant persons for whom behavioral counsel
1b40: ing alone does not work, evidence to support other options to in
1b80: crease smoking cessation during pregnancy are limited. Few clini
1bc0: cal trials have evaluated the effectiveness of NRT for smoking c
1c00: essation in pregnant women. Although most studies were in the di
1c40: rection of benefit, no statistically significant increase in ces
1c80: sation was seen.<sup>13</sup> There is limited evidence on harms
1cc0:  of NRT from trials in pregnant persons. Potential adverse mater
1d00: nal events reported in studies of NRT include slightly increased
1d40:  diastolic blood pressure and skin reactions to the patch.<sup>1
1d80: 3</sup> Potential adverse events reported in nonpregnant adults 
1dc0: include higher rates of low-risk cardiovascular events, such as 
1e00: tachycardia.<sup>13</sup> It has been suggested that NRT may be 
1e40: safer than smoking during pregnancy given that cigarette smoke c
1e80: ontains harmful substances in addition to nicotine. The USPSTF i
1ec0: dentified no studies on bupropion SR or varenicline pharmacother
1f00: apy for tobacco smoking cessation during pregnancy.</p>\r\n<p>In
1f40:  the absence of clear evidence on the balance of benefits and ha
1f80: rms of pharmacotherapy in pregnant women, clinicians are encoura
1fc0: ged to consider the severity of tobacco dependence in each patie
2000: nt and engage in shared decision-making to determine the best in
2040: dividual treatment course.</p>\r\n<h4>e-Cigarettes in Nonpregnan
2080: t Adults and Pregnant Persons</h4>\r\n<p>No tobacco product use 
20c0: is risk-free, including the use of e-cigarettes. Tobacco smoking
2100:  cessation can be difficult for many individuals; thus, having a
2140:  variety of tools available to help persons quit smoking would p
2180: otentially be helpful. Findings from small surveys and qualitati
21c0: ve data report mixed findings on whether physicians are recommen
2200: ding e-cigarettes to patients to help them quit smoking.<sup>13,
2240: 49-51</sup> Few randomized trials have evaluated the effectivene
2280: ss of e-cigarettes to increase tobacco smoking cessation in nonp
22c0: regnant adults, and no trials have evaluated e-cigarettes for to
2300: bacco smoking cessation in pregnant persons.<sup>13</sup> Overal
2340: l, results were mixed on whether smoking cessation increased wit
2380: h e-cigarettes; however, continued e-cigarette use after the int
23c0: ervention phase of trials remained high, indicating continued ni
2400: cotine dependence. Trial evidence on harms of e-cigarettes used 
2440: for smoking cessation is also limited. The most commonly reporte
2480: d adverse effects from e-cigarette use reported in trials includ
24c0: ed coughing, nausea, throat irritation, and sleep disruption.<su
2500: p>13</sup> Generally, no significant difference in short-term se
2540: rious adverse events associated with e-cigarette use was reporte
2580: d.<sup>13</sup> Evidence on potential harms of e-cigarette use i
25c0: n general (whether for tobacco smoking cessation or not) has bee
2600: n reviewed in the National Academies of Science, Engineering, an
2640: d Medicine report Public Health Consequences of E-Cigarettes.<su
2680: p>52</sup> For example, the report found conclusive evidence tha
26c0: t in addition to nicotine, most e-cigarette products contain and
2700:  emit numerous potentially toxic substances. Additionally, an ou
2740: tbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping product, use&ndash;associated l
2780: ung injury (EVALI) that occurred in the US in late 2019 also sug
27c0: gests potential harms of e-cigarette use. The vast majority of c
2800: ases have been associated with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)&ndash;
2840: containing e-cigarettes.<sup>53</sup></p>\r\n<p>Given the high r
2880: ates of e-cigarette use in children and adolescents currently in
28c0:  the US,<sup>54</sup> the USPSTF recognizes that an overall publ
2900: ic health question remains on whether the potential use of e-cig
2940: arettes as a tobacco smoking cessation aid (if ever proven effec
2980: tive) could be balanced with the high rates of e-cigarette use i
29c0: n youth as a driver for increasing overall tobacco use. The USPS
2a00: TF has issued a separate recommendation statement on the prevent
2a40: ion of tobacco use, including e-cigarettes, in children and adol
2a80: escents.<sup>9</sup> The current USPSTF recommendation statement
2ac0:  for adults evaluated the evidence on the benefits and harms of 
2b00: e-cigarettes to increase tobacco cessation; the USPSTF found thi
2b40: s evidence to be insufficient. Given the proven effectiveness of
2b80:  behavioral counseling interventions in both nonpregnant and pre
2bc0: gnant adults, and of pharmacotherapy in nonpregnant adults, the 
2c00: USPSTF recommends that clinicians focus on offering behavioral c
2c40: ounseling and pharmacotherapy to increase smoking cessation in n
2c80: onpregnant adults, and behavioral counseling to increase smoking
2cc0:  cessation in pregnant persons.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF 
2d00: Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>In 2020, the USPSTF recommended that 
2d40: primary care clinicians provide interventions, including educati
2d80: on or brief counseling, to prevent the initiation of tobacco use
2dc0:  (including e-cigarettes) in school-aged children and adolescent
2e00: s.<sup>9</sup> The USPSTF found the evidence on primary care int
2e40: erventions for the cessation of tobacco use in youth to be insuf
2e80: ficient.</p><h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h2><p>
2ec0: This recommendation statement replaces the 2015 USPSTF recommend

1500: gineering, and Medicine report found that in youth and young adu
1540: lts, there is substantial evidence that e-cigarette use increase
1580: s risk of ever using combustible tobacco and moderate evidence t
15c0: hat e-cigarette use increases the frequency and intensity of sub
1600: sequent cigarette smoking.<sup>52</sup> The report also found co
1640: nclusive evidence that e-cigarettes contain and emit potentially
1680:  toxic substances, although substantial evidence shows that othe
16c0: r than nicotine, there is significantly lower exposure to potent
1700: ially toxic substances from e-cigarettes compared with combustib
1740: le tobacco cigarettes.<sup>52</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Response to Comme
1780: nts</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement 
17c0: was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from June 2,
1800:  2020, to June 29, 2020. Several comments expressed concern abou
1840: t the insufficient evidence statement on e-cigarettes for cessat
1880: ion. Some respondents wanted the USPSTF to recommend against e-c
18c0: igarettes for tobacco cessation, while others wanted the USPSTF 
1900: to recommend in favor of e-cigarettes. Based on the evidence rev
1940: iewed, the USPSTF could not determine whether e-cigarettes are e
1980: ffective in helping persons to quit smoking cigarettes, nor coul
19c0: d it determine what the potential long-term harms of e-cigarette
1a00:  use are; thus, it cannot recommend for or against their use. So
1a40: me comments were also received requesting that the USPSTF recomm
1a80: end NRT for smoking cessation during pregnancy. Too few trials w
1ac0: ere identified for the USPSTF to determine whether NRT during pr
1b00: egnancy provides overall more benefits or harms, and the USPSTF 
1b40: calls for more research on NRT and other pharmacotherapy to help
1b80:  pregnant persons quit using tobacco. Last, edits to clarify lan
1bc0: guage, as well as additional information from the recent 2020 Su
1c00: rgeon General&rsquo;s Report on Smoking Cessation, have been pro
1c40: vided in response to comments.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Evidence Fit 
1c80: With Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Because of the well-es
1cc0: tablished health benefits of smoking cessation,<sup>1,12,47</sup
1d00: > most of the research on interventions for smoking cessation fo
1d40: cuses on cessation (rather than health outcomes) as a primary ou
1d80: tcome. The current review identified 1 study<sup>90</sup> of mid
1dc0: dle-aged men at high risk for cardiorespiratory disease that fou
1e00: nd lower (although not statistically significant) total mortalit
1e40: y, fatal coronary disease, and lung cancer death at 20 years of 
1e80: follow-up in participants who received advice from medical pract
1ec0: itioners.<sup>91</sup> The study also found some reduction in al
1f00: l-cause mortality, coronary disease mortality, and lung cancer i
1f40: ncidence and mortality at 20 years of follow-up, although these 
1f80: outcomes were not significant.<sup>91</sup></p>\r\n<p>Although n
1fc0: ot zero, less toxins have been found to be released by e-cigaret
2000: tes than by cigarettes. It is hypothesized that health outcomes 
2040: may be improved in adults who completely switch from cigarette s
2080: moking to e-cigarette use, although long-term data are not avail
20c0: able yet to support this. Evidence on long-term harms of e-cigar
2100: ette use in general is lacking and is needed. Additionally, emer
2140: ging evidence suggests that toxicant levels in dual users of e-c
2180: igarettes and cigarettes may be higher than in conventional ciga
21c0: rette&ndash;only users.<sup>92</sup></p><h2>Research Needs and G
2200: aps</h2><p>The greatest research needs are to gain a better unde
2240: rstanding of the effectiveness of e-cigarettes for smoking cessa
2280: tion, as well as potential short- and long-term harms of e-cigar
22c0: ette use, and to understand whether there are effective pharmaco

2340: ettes: Given the potential negative effect that increasing e-cig

23c0: , there is an urgent need for research that provides both a clea
2400: rer understanding of whether e-cigarettes may increase adult tob
2440: acco smoking cessation, as well as the potential harms of e-ciga

24c0: for smoking cessation in adults should address the following:\r\
2500: n<ul>\r\n<li>Studies must be well-designed RCTs that compare e-c

2640: </li>\r\n<li>Given the high rate of continued e-cigarette use af
2680: ter smoking cessation, research on both the short- and long-term
26c0:  harms of e-cigarette use is needed, as well as the harms in dua

2740: ch is needed on smoking relapse rates in adults who have used e-
2780: cigarettes for smoking cessation and how to help with cessation 
27c0: of e-cigarette use once smoking abstinence has been achieved.</l
2800: i>\r\n<li>Given the rapidly evolving landscape of e-cigarettes, 
2840: trials should include current generations of e-cigarettes. Addit

2980: uth and the risk factors for their transition from e-cigarette u
29c0: se to conventional cigarette smoking.</li>\r\n<li>More research 
2a00: is also needed to better understand patterns of e-cigarette use 
2a40: in pregnant persons and potential harms of e-cigarette use to bo

2b40: rsons: Although behavioral counseling interventions have been fo
2b80: und to be effective in improving smoking cessation during pregna
2bc0: ncy, additional research is needed on pharmacotherapy options, i
2c00: n particular NRT, for pregnant persons for whom behavioral couns
2c40: eling interventions alone are not effective.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Larg
2c80: er studies adequately powered to detect an effect on both smokin
2cc0: g cessation rates (during pregnancy and postpartum) and changes 
2d00: in perinatal and child health outcomes are needed.</li>\r\n<li>A
2d40:  better understanding of why adherence rates to NRT during pregn
2d80: ancy is so low would also be helpful.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n

2e00: ventions and pharmacotherapy in nonpregnant adults and the benef
2e40: its of behavioral counseling interventions in pregnant adults ar
2e80: e well established, additional research on effective components 
2ec0: of behavioral counseling and who to target specific intervention
2f00: s to would be informative. More research on newer modalities and
2f40:  remotely delivered interventions (mobile phone apps, internet-b

0780: s at increased risk for STIs.</p>\r\n<h3>Definition of STIs</h3>
07c0: \r\n<p>Sexually transmitted infections are transmitted through s
0800: exual activity and intimate physical contact. In the US, common 
0840: STIs with significant clinical and public health effects include
0880:  HIV, herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatiti
08c0: s B virus (HBV), <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, <em>Neisseria g
0900: onorrhea</em>, <em>Treponema pallidum</em> (syphilis), and <em>T
0940: richomonas vaginalis</em>.<sup>1-4</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Assessment o
0980: f Risk</h3>\r\n<p>All sexually active adolescents are at increas
09c0: ed risk for STIs because of the high rates of STIs in this age g
0a00: roup and should receive behavioral counseling interventions. Adu
0a40: lts at increased risk for STIs include those who currently have 
0a80: an STI or were diagnosed with one within the past year, do not c
0ac0: onsistently use condoms, have multiple sex partners, or have sex
0b00:  partners within populations with a high prevalence of STIs. Pop
0b40: ulations with a high prevalence of STIs include persons who seek
0b80:  STI testing or attend STI clinics; sexual and gender minorities
0bc0: ; persons who are living with HIV, inject drugs, have exchanged 
0c00: sex for money or drugs, or have entered correctional facilities;
0c40:  and some racial/ethnic minority groups.<sup>1-4</sup> Differenc
0c80: e in STI rates among racial/ethnic groups may reflect difference
0cc0: s in social determinants of health.<sup>2</sup> To determine whi
0d00: ch adolescents are sexually active, and which adults might engag
0d40: e in activities that may increase their risk for STIs, clinician
0d80: s should routinely ask their patients for pertinent information 
0dc0: about their sexual history.</p>\r\n<h3>Behavioral Counseling Int
0e00: erventions</h3>\r\n<p>Intervention approaches include in-person 
0e40: counseling, videos, websites, written materials, telephone suppo
0e80: rt, and text messages. Most successful approaches provide inform
0ec0: ation on common STIs and STI transmission; assess the person&rsq
0f00: uo;s risk for acquiring STIs; aim to increase motivation or comm
0f40: itment to safer sex practices; and provide training in condom us
0f80: e, communication about safer sex, problem solving, and other per
0fc0: tinent skills. Interventions that include group counseling and i
1000: nvolve high total contact times (defined in the evidence review 
1040: as more than 120 minutes), often delivered over multiple session
1080: s, are associated with larger STI prevention effects. However, s
10c0: ome less intensive interventions have been shown to reduce STI a
1100: cquisition, increase condom use, or decrease number of sex partn
1140: ers. Interventions shorter than 30 minutes tended to be delivere
1180: d in a single session. There is not enough evidence to determine

0780: ing language to the Risk Assessment section. Comments seeking ad
07c0: ditional clarification on recommended interventions were also re
0800: ceived. Where the USPSTF was able to provide more details, it di
0840: d so in the Behavioral Counseling Interventions subsection of th
0880: e Practice Considerations section. Comments also highlighted add
08c0: itional research needs, which have been included in the Research
0900:  Needs and Gaps section. Some comments requested that the curren
0940: t recommendation discuss HIV preexposure prophylaxis; HIV preexp
0980: osure prophylaxis is addressed in a separate USPSTF recommendati
09c0: on.<sup>32</sup> A few comments requested clearer guidance on ho
0a00: w to provide counseling in situations in which the sexual activi
0a40: ty is not in the control of the patient (such as sexual traffick
0a80: ing or abuse). The USPSTF acknowledges the importance of helping
0ac0:  persons in this situation, which goes beyond counseling on how 
0b00: to prevent STIs. The USPSTF added a link to relevant resources p

0bc0: by the USPSTF enrolled heterosexual girls, women, and men at inc
0c00: reased risk for STI acquisition. More research on counseling int
0c40: erventions to prevent STIs is needed in sexually active boys; pr
0c80: egnant persons; gay, lesbian, bisexual, nonbinary, and transgend
0cc0: er persons; and older adults at increased risk; as well as in ad
0d00: olescents who are not yet sexually active. Research on intervent
0d40: ions that engage couples or sex partners of primary care patient
0d80: s is also needed. More national-level data on prevalence of STIs
0dc0:  in certain risk groups are also needed, including lesbian, bise
0e00: xual, nonbinary, and transgender persons. Additional research is
0e40:  needed on understanding the role of social determinants of heal
0e80: th in contributing to increased STI rates.</p>\r\n<p>Few trials 
0ec0: incorporated sexual risk assessment performed by primary care cl
0f00: inicians, and less than one-half of trials assessed intervention
0f40: s delivered by clinicians, nurses, psychologists, or other healt
0f80: h professionals. Because many trials were conducted in STI clini
0fc0: cs, research that is more applicable to general primary care pop
1000: ulations would be valuable, such as trials that test interventio
1040: ns delivered in primary care settings, obstetrics clinics, and f
1080: amily planning and women&rsquo;s health clinics, or that is endo
10c0: rsed by primary care clinicians for patients who report increase
1100: d STI risk based on well-defined risk assessment methods.</p>\r\
1140: n<p>Trials that follow up participants for longer than 12 months
1180:  are needed to assess the durability of intervention effects.</p
11c0: >\r\n<p>Research is needed to develop and test interventions tha

2fc0: ntervals</h3>\r\n<p>The 2 lung cancer screening trials that show

3080: ally for 3 years.<sup>9</sup> The Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker

3400: 3>\r\n<p>Available data indicate that uptake of lung cancer scre
3440: ening is low. One recent study using data for 10 states found th
3480: at 14.4% of persons eligible for lung cancer screening (based on
34c0:  2013 USPSTF criteria) had been screened in the prior 12 months.

3540: ffering screening to eligible persons who express a preference f

35c0: ancer screening.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Screening Eligibility
3600: , Screening Intervals, and Starting and Stopping Ages</h4>\r\n<p
3640: >As noted above, the USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung
3680:  cancer with LDCT in adults aged 50 to 80 years who have at leas
36c0: t a 20 pack-year smoking history. Screening should be discontinu
3700: ed once a person has not smoked for 15 years.</p>\r\n<p>The NLST
3740: <sup>9</sup> and the NELSON trial<sup>11</sup> enrolled generall
3780: y healthy persons, so those study findings may not accurately re
37c0: flect the balance of benefits and harms in persons with comorbid
3800:  conditions. The USPSTF recommends discontinuing screening if a 
3840: person develops a health problem that substantially limits life 
3880: expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung s
38c0: urgery.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Smoking Cessation Counseling</
3900: h4>\r\n<p>All persons enrolled in a screening program who are cu
3940: rrent smokers should receive smoking cessation interventions. To
3980:  be consistent with the USPSTF recommendation on counseling and 
39c0: interventions to prevent tobacco use and tobacco-caused disease,
3a00: <sup>19</sup> persons referred for lung cancer screening through
3a40:  primary care should receive these interventions concurrent with
3a80:  referral. Because many persons may enter screening through path
3ac0: ways besides referral from primary care, the USPSTF encourages i
3b00: ncorporating such interventions into all screening programs.<em>
3b40: &nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Shared Decision-Making</h4>\r\n<p>Shared 
3b80: decision-making is important when clinicians and patients discus
3bc0: s screening for lung cancer. The benefit of screening varies wit
3c00: h risk because persons at higher risk are more likely to benefit
3c40: . Screening does not prevent most lung cancer deaths; thus, smok
3c80: ing cessation remains essential. Lung cancer screening has the p
3cc0: otential to cause harm, including false-positive results and inc
3d00: idental findings that can lead to subsequent testing and treatme
3d40: nt, including the anxiety of living with a lung lesion that may 
3d80: be cancer. Overdiagnosis of lung cancer and the risks of radiati
3dc0: on exposure are harms, although their exact magnitude is uncerta
3e00: in. The decision to undertake screening should involve a thoroug
3e40: h discussion of the potential benefits, limitations, and harms o
3e80: f screening.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Standardization of LDCT S
3ec0: creening and Follow-up of Abnormal Findings</h4>\r\n<p>The rando
3f00: mized clinical trials (RCTs) that provide evidence for the benef
3f40: it of screening for lung cancer with LDCT were primarily conduct
3f80: ed in academic centers with expertise in the performance and int
3fc0: erpretation of LDCT and the management of lung lesions

0000: seen on LDCT. Clinical settings that have similar experience and
0040:  expertise are more likely to duplicate the beneficial results f
0080: ound in trials.</p>\r\n<p>In an effort to minimize the uncertain
00c0: ty and variation about the evaluation and management of lung nod
0100: ules and to standardize the reporting of LDCT screening results,

1280: Evidence</h2><h3>Scope of Review</h3>\r\n<p>To update its 2013 r
12c0: ecommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review<sup>2
1300: 4,25</sup> on the accuracy of screening for lung cancer with LDC
1340: T and the benefits and harms of screening for lung cancer. The r
1380: eview also assessed whether the benefits of screening vary by su
13c0: bgroup (eg, by race or sex) or by the number or frequency of LDC
1400: T scans and whether the harms associated with screening and the 
1440: evaluation of lung nodules differ with the use of Lung-RADS, Int
1480: ernational Early Lung Cancer Action Program (I-ELCAP), or simila
14c0: r approaches (eg, to reduce false-positive results). In addition
1500: , the review assessed whether the use of risk prediction models 
1540: for identifying adults at higher risk of lung cancer mortality i
1580: mproves the balance of benefits and harms of screening compared 
15c0: with the use of trial eligibility criteria or variants of the pr
1600: ior USPSTF recommendation criteria.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the
1640:  systematic evidence review, the USPSTF commissioned collaborati
1680: ve modeling studies from CISNET<sup>14,15</sup> to provide infor
16c0: mation about the optimal age at which to begin and end screening
1700: , the optimal screening interval, and the relative benefits and 
1740: harms of different screening strategies, including risk factor&n
1780: dash;based strategies using age, pack-year smoking history, and 
17c0: years since quitting smoking for former smokers, compared with m
1800: odified versions of multivariate risk prediction models. The mod
1840: eling studies complement the evidence that the systematic review
1880:  provides.</p>\r\n<h3>Accuracy of Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>The
18c0:  USPSTF reviewed several RCTs and cohort studies that reported o
1900: n the sensitivity, specificity, or predictive value of LDCT, usi
1940: ng eventual diagnosis of lung cancer as the reference standard.<
1980: sup>24,25</sup> Not all of the reviewed studies reported all tes
19c0: t accuracy data. In the studies that reported it, sensitivity ra
1a00: nged from 59% to 100%, specificity ranged from 26.4% to 99.7%, p
1a40: ositive predictive value ranged from 3.3% to 43.5%, and negative
1a80:  predictive value ranged from 97.7% to 100%.</p>\r\n<p>In the NL
1ac0: ST<sup>26</sup> and NELSON trial,<sup>11</sup> the reported sens
1b00: itivities were 93.1% and 59%, respectively, and reported specifi
1b40: cities were 76.5% and 95.8%, respectively. Although the negative
1b80:  predictive values were similar for the NLST and NELSON trial (9
1bc0: 9.9% and 97.7%, respectively), the positive predictive values we
1c00: re very different (3.3% and 43.5%, respectively). This discrepan
1c40: cy is largely accounted for by the trials&rsquo; differing defin
1c80: itions of a positive finding and screening protocols&mdash;the N
1cc0: ELSON trial used a volumetric approach and added an indeterminat
1d00: e nodule result category (ie, an indeterminate finding was not c
1d40: onsidered a positive result even if it led to additional testing
1d80: ). The NLST used an approach of maximum diameter without an inde
1dc0: terminate category (ie, any nodule meeting the diameter criteria
1e00:  was considered a positive result).</p>\r\n<p>Three retrospectiv
1e40: e studies compared how various approaches for nodule classificat
1e80: ion would alter the accuracy of LDCT.<sup>21,27,28</sup> The fir
1ec0: st study demonstrated that using Lung-RADS in the NLST would hav
1f00: e increased specificity while decreasing sensitivity.<sup>21</su
1f40: p> The other 2 studies found that use of I-ELCAP criteria (incre
1f80: ase in nodule size threshold to an average diameter of 5 mm, 6 m
1fc0: m, or larger) would increase positive predictive value.<sup>27,2

2040: >\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 7 RCTs that evaluated lung cancer sc
2080: reening with LDCT.<sup>24,25</sup> The NLST<sup>9</sup> and the 
20c0: NELSON trial<sup>11</sup> were the only trials adequately powere
2100: d to detect a lung cancer mortality benefit.</p>\r\n<p>The NLST,
2140:  the largest RCT to date (n...=...53,454), enrolled participants
2180:  aged 55 to 74 years at the time of randomization who had a toba
21c0: cco use history of at least 30 pack-years and were current smoke
2200: rs or had quit within the past 15 years. The mean pack-year smok
2240: ing history in NLST participants was 56 pack-years.<sup>9</sup> 
2280: The NELSON trial (n...=...15,792) enrolled participants aged 50 
22c0: to 74 years who had a tobacco use history of at least 15 cigaret
2300: tes a day (three-fourths of a pack per day) for more than 25 yea
2340: rs or 10 cigarettes a day (one-half of a pack per day) for more 
2380: than 30 years and were current smokers or had quit within the pa
23c0: st 10 years. The median pack-year smoking history in NELSON tria
2400: l participants was 38 pack-years.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<p>The NLS
2440: T reported a relative risk reduction in lung cancer mortality of
2480:  20% (95% CI, 6.8%-26.7%)9; a subsequent analysis of NLST data w
24c0: ith additional follow-up and end point verification reported a r
2500: elative risk reduction of 16% (95% CI, 5%-25%).<sup>10</sup> At 
2540: 10 years of follow-up, the NELSON trial reported 181 lung cancer
2580:  deaths among participants in the screening group and 242 in the
25c0:  control group (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.75 [95% CI, 0.61-0
2600: .90]).<sup>11,24</sup> The NLST also found a reduction in all-ca
2640: use mortality with LDCT screening compared with chest radiograph
2680: y (IRR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.88-0.99]). Results of the other trials w
26c0: ere imprecise, without any statistically significant differences
2700:  between screening with LDCT and chest radiography or no screeni
2740: ng.<sup>24</sup></p>\r\n<p>Evidence on screening interval comes 
2780: from the NLST and the NELSON trial and CISNET modeling studies. 
27c0: The NLST screened annually for 3 years.<sup>9</sup> The NELSON t
2800: rial screened at intervals of 1 year, then 2 years, then 2.5 yea
2840: rs.<sup>11</sup> The CISNET modeling studies suggest that annual
2880:  screening with LDCT provides greater benefit in decreasing lung
28c0:  cancer mortality and in life-years gained compared with biennia
2900: l screening.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<p>Several lines of evidence su
2940: ggest that screening for lung cancer in persons with fewer pack-
2980: years of smoking (ie, fewer than the 30 pack-year eligibility cr
29c0: iterion of the 2013 USPSTF recommendation) and at an earlier age
2a00:  can increase the benefits of screening. As noted, the NELSON tr
2a40: ial enrolled persons aged 50 to 74 years (about one-fourth of pa
2a80: rticipants were younger than 55 years) who had accumulated fewer
2ac0:  pack-years of smoking (half of a pack per day for more than 30 
2b00: years or three-fourths of a pack per day for more than 25 years)
2b40: .<sup>11</sup> This trial provides empirical evidence for the be
2b80: nefit of screening for lung cancer with LDCT in persons aged 50 
2bc0: to 55 years and with lighter pack-year smoking histories.</p>\r\
2c00: n<p>The CISNET modeling studies also provided data that helped i
2c40: nform the pack-year eligibility criterion for lung cancer screen
2c80: ing and the ages at which to start and stop screening. The USPST
2cc0: F focused on screening programs in the 1960 birth cohort (more r
2d00: epresentative of current smoking patterns compared with earlier 
2d40: cohorts) that yielded lung cancer mortality reductions at least 
2d80: as great as the 2013 USPSTF screening program (A-55-80-30-15). F
2dc0: or screening programs that provide this level of mortality benef
2e00: it and also maximize, or come close to maximizing, both lung can
2e40: cer deaths averted and life-years gained for any given level of 
2e80: LDCT screening, in at least 3 of the 4 CISNET models (ie, &ldquo
2ec0: ;consensus-efficient&rdquo; programs), the majority (52%) have a
2f00:  minimum pack-year eligibility criterion of 20 pack-years. Almos
2f40: t all have a starting age of 50 or 55 years, and all have a stop
2f80: ping age of 80 years.<sup>14,15</sup></p>\r\n<p>Relative to the 
2fc0: 2013 USPSTF screening program (A-55-80-30-15), CISNET modeling a
3000: nalyses suggest that annually screening persons aged 50 to 80 ye
3040: ars who have at least a 20 pack-year smoking history and current
3080: ly smoke or have quit within the past 15 years (A-50-80-20-15) w
30c0: ould be associated with lung cancer mortality reduced by 13.0% v
3100: s 9.8%, with avoiding 503 vs 381 lung cancer deaths, and with 69
3140: 18 life-years gained vs 4882 life-years gained per 100,000 perso
3180: ns in the population aged 45 to 90 years over a lifetime of scre
31c0: ening.<sup>14</sup> Thus, this screening program would be associ
3200: ated with important reductions in lung cancer deaths and increas
3240: es in life-years gained compared with the previous recommendatio
3280: n and is supported by new trial data and the CISNET modeling stu
32c0: dies.</p>\r\n<p>Screening for lung cancer in persons at an earli
3300: er age and with fewer pack-years of smoking (ie, 20 pack-years) 
3340: may also help partially ameliorate racial disparities in screeni
3380: ng eligibility. Data suggest that Black persons who smoke have a
33c0:  higher risk of lung cancer than do White persons, and this risk
3400:  difference is more apparent at lower levels of smoking intensit
3440: y.<sup>7</sup> One recent analysis of Southern Community Cohort 
3480: Study participants found that 17% of Black persons who smoke wer
34c0: e eligible for lung cancer screening based on the 2013 USPSTF el
3500: igibility criteria compared with 31% of White persons who smoke.
3540:  In the same study, among persons diagnosed with lung cancer, a 
3580: significantly lower percentage of Black persons who smoke (32%) 
35c0: were eligible for screening than were White persons (56%).<sup>2
3600: 9</sup> Data also suggest that Latinx/Hispanic persons who smoke
3640:  accumulate fewer pack-years than White persons who smoke.<sup>3
3680: 0,31</sup> A strategy of annually screening persons aged 50 to 8
36c0: 0 years who have at least a 20 pack-year smoking history and cur
3700: rently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years (A-50-80-20-1
3740: 5) would increase the relative percentage of persons eligible fo
3780: r screening by 87% overall&mdash;78% in non-Hispanic White adult
37c0: s, 107% in non-Hispanic Black adults, and 112% in Hispanic adult
3800: s compared with 2013 USPSTF criteria (A-55-80-30-15).<sup>14</su
3840: p> Similarly, a strategy of screening persons aged 50 to 80 year
3880: s who have at least a 20 pack-year smoking history and currently
38c0:  smoke or have quit within the past 15 years (A-50-80-20-15) wou
3900: ld increase the relative percentage of persons eligible for scre
3940: ening by 80% in men and by 96% in women,<sup>14</sup> because th
3980: ey accumulate fewer pack-years than men.<sup>32</sup></p>\r\n<p>
39c0: Simulation studies suggest that risk prediction models to determ
3a00: ine eligibility for lung cancer screening could be associated wi
3a40: th reduced lung cancer deaths and the number of participants nee
3a80: ded to screen to prevent 1 lung cancer death. The CISNET modelin
3ac0: g studies commissioned by the USPSTF thus compared the benefits 
3b00: and harms of screening programs based on risk prediction models 
3b40: vs risk factor&ndash;based screening (ie, using age and smoking 
3b80: history). The risk prediction models used were modified versions
3bc0:  of the PLCOm2012 model,<sup>33</sup> the Lung Cancer Death Risk
3c00:  Assessment Tool (LCDRAT) model,<sup>34</sup> and the Bach model
3c40: ,<sup>35</sup> limited to age, sex (for those models that includ
3c80: e sex as a variable, such as the LCDRAT and Bach models), smokin
3cc0: g intensity, and smoking duration (and setting other potential v
3d00: ariables such as race, education, body mass index, personal hist
3d40: ory of cancer, or family history of lung cancer to their referen
3d80: ce value). Because age is an important risk factor for lung canc
3dc0: er, these risk prediction models shifted screening to persons of
3e00:  older age and increased the number of lung cancer deaths averte
3e40: d, but screening occurs at older ages when there are fewer years
3e80:  to be gained. Thus, some risk prediction model&ndash;based scre
3ec0: ening programs were associated with slightly increased life-year
3f00: s gained, while some were not or were associated with even sligh
3f40: tly decreased life-years gained. Risk prediction models also wer
3f80: e associated with increased the number of over diagnosed lung ca
3fc0: ncers, which are more common in older individuals.<sup>

0000: 14</sup></p>\r\n<p>It is possible that the use of a more complex
0040:  risk prediction model to determine eligibility might impose a b
0080: arrier to wider implementation and uptake of lung cancer screeni
00c0: ng, a service that currently has low uptake. Currently, there ar
0100: e no studies that have prospectively compared the use of USPSTF 
0140: criteria considering age, pack-year smoking history, and number 
0180: of years since quitting vs risk prediction models as criteria fo
01c0: r lung cancer screening, so it is uncertain whether using a risk
0200:  prediction model would improve lung cancer detection and clinic
0240: al outcomes. The International Lung Screening Trial (ILST), a pr
0280: ospective cohort study that is comparing the accuracy of the PLC
02c0: Om2012 model against the 2013 USPSTF criteria for detecting lung
0300:  cancer, may provide some evidence regarding this issue.<sup>36<
0340: /sup> In summary, determining eligibility for lung cancer screen
0380: ing using more complex risk prediction models may represent an i
03c0: mplementation barrier, and there is currently insufficient evide

04c0:  Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Harms of screening can include false-posit
0500: ive results leading to unnecessary tests and invasive procedures
0540: , overdiagnosis, radiation-induced cancer, incidental findings, 
0580: and increases in distress or anxiety.</p>\r\n<p>The NLST reporte
05c0: d false-positive rates of 26.3% for baseline, 27.2% for year 1, 
0600: and 15.9% for year 2.9 The NELSON trial reported false-positive 
0640: rates of 19.8% at baseline, 7.1% at year 1, 9.0% for males at ye
0680: ar 3, and 3.9% for males at year 5.5 of screening.<sup>11,37</su
06c0: p> An implementation study through the Veterans Health Administr
0700: ation revealed a false-positive rate of 28.9% of veterans eligib
0740: le for screening (58% of those who were actually screened) at ba
0780: seline.<sup>38</sup> Both of these studies were conducted prior 
07c0: to the use of the Lung-RADS protocol for nodule classification, 
0800: the use of which may reduce false-positives, albeit at the cost 
0840: of some false-negatives. One retrospective study assessed how us
0880: e of Lung-RADS would have changed the false-positive result rate
08c0:  in the NLST and found a false-positive rate among baseline resu
0900: lts for Lung-RADS of 12.8% (95% CI, 12.4%-13.2%) vs 26.6% (95% C
0940: I, 26.1%-27.1%) for the NLST approach.<sup>21</sup></p>\r\n<p>Th
0980: e further workup of false-positive results can result in signifi
09c0: cant harms such as additional imaging, biopsy, or surgical proce
0a00: dures. Fourteen studies reported on the evaluation of false-posi
0a40: tive results. Among all patients screened, the percentage who ha
0a80: d a needle biopsy for false-positive results ranged from 0.09% t
0ac0: o 0.56%. Complication rates from needle biopsy for false-positiv
0b00: e results ranged from 0.03% to 0.07% of all patients screened. S
0b40: urgical procedures for false-positive results were reported in 0
0b80: .5% to 1.3% of all screened participants.<sup>24</sup></p>\r\n<p
0bc0: >In the NLST, false-positive results led to invasive procedures 
0c00: (needle biopsy, thoracotomy, thoracoscopy, mediastinoscopy, and 
0c40: bronchoscopy) in 1.7% of patients screened. Complications occurr
0c80: ed in 0.1% of patients screened, and death in the 60 days follow
0cc0: ing the most invasive procedure performed to evaluate a false-po
0d00: sitive result occurred in 0.007% of those screened.<sup>9</sup> 
0d40: One study estimated that the use of Lung-RADS criteria would hav
0d80: e prevented 23.4% of invasive procedures due to false-positive r
0dc0: esults.<sup>21</sup></p>\r\n<p>In the CISNET modeling studies, t
0e00: he false-positive rate varied based on screening eligibility cri
0e40: teria. Relative to the 2013 USPSTF criteria (A-55-80-30-15), the
0e80:  2021 USPSTF criteria (A-50-80-20-15) would result in 2.2 vs 1.9

21c0: p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted fo
2200: r public comment on the USPSTF website from July 7, 2020, to Aug
2240: ust 3, 2020. Most comments generally agreed with the draft recom
2280: mendation, although some requested broadening the eligibility cr
22c0: iteria for lung cancer screening and others mentioned that addit
2300: ional risk factors for lung cancer other than smoking exist or t
2340: hat lung cancer can occur in persons who never smoked. In respon
2380: se, the USPSTF acknowledges that there are risk factors for lung
23c0:  cancer other than smoking; however, current evidence does not s
2400: upport the incorporation of these risk factors as determinants o
2440: f eligibility for lung cancer screening. The USPSTF also acknowl
2480: edges that lung cancer can occur in persons who never smoked or 
24c0: among persons who currently smoke or formerly smoked who do not 
2500: meet screening eligibility criteria. Nevertheless, smoking is th
2540: e major risk factor for lung cancer, all trials of screening for
2580:  lung cancer have been conducted among persons who smoke or were
25c0:  former smokers, and trial and modeling data support the current
2600:  USPSTF recommendation as offering a reasonable balance of benef
2640: its and harms.</p>\r\n<p>Some comments suggested the use of more
2680:  complex risk prediction models to determine eligibility for lun
26c0: g cancer screening. In response, the USPSTF clarified language t
2700: hat use of these risk prediction models might make implementatio
2740: n more difficult, and that there are currently no lung cancer sc
2780: reening trials prospectively comparing USPSTF eligibility criter
27c0: ia with risk prediction models. The USPSTF also added a referenc
2800: e to the ILST, a prospective cohort study addressing this issue.
2840: </p>\r\n<p>In response to comments, the USPSTF also added inform
2880: ation about the currently low uptake of lung cancer screening an
28c0: d data on the effect of the current recommendation on eligibilit

29c0: ith Biological Understanding?</h3>\r\n<p>Lung cancer is a prolif
2a00: eration of malignant cells that originate in lung tissue. Smokin
2a40: g is the strongest risk factor for lung cancer. Older age is als
2a80: o associated with increasing incidence of lung cancer. Lung canc
2ac0: er is classified into 2 major categories based on cell type and 
2b00: immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics: NSCLC, which 
2b40: collectively comprises adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, 
2b80: and large cell carcinoma, and small cell lung cancer. Screening 
2bc0: is aimed at early detection of NSCLC rather than small cell lung
2c00:  cancer because the latter is much less common and typically spr
2c40: eads too quickly to be reliably detected at an early, potentiall
2c80: y curable stage by screening.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, 79% of patien
2cc0: ts present with lung cancer that has spread to regional lymph no
2d00: des or metastasized to distant sites. Only 17% of patients prese
2d40: nt with localized disease. Patients with localized disease have 
2d80: a 59% 5-year survival rate, compared with 32% for those with reg
2dc0: ional spread and 6% for those with distant metastases.<sup>1</su

0e00: dical use of prescription medications; that is, drug use for rea
0e40: sons, for duration, in amounts, or with frequency other than pre
0e80: scribed, or use by persons other than the prescribed individual.
0ec0:  Nonmedical drug use also includes the use of over-the-counter m

12c0: onal, or legal outcomes).</p>\r\n<h3>Other Related USPSTF Recomm
1300: endations</h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF has several recommendations on s
1340: ubstance use&ndash;related services for young persons. The USPST
1380: F is currently updating its recommendations on screening for ill
13c0: icit drug use in adults 18 years and older (B recommendation) an
1400: d in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (I statement).<sup>5</sup> 
1440: The USPSTF also has recommendations on screening and behavioral 
1480: counseling interventions to reduce unhealthy alcohol use in adul
14c0: ts 18 years and older (B recommendation) and adolescents aged 12
1500:  to 17 years (I statement).<sup>6</sup> In addition, the USPSTF 
1540: is currently updating its recommendations on education or brief

1680: Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>\r\n<h4>P
16c0: otential Preventable Burden</h4>\r\n<p>Illicit drug use is assoc
1700: iated with multiple negative health, social, and economic conseq
1740: uences. In 2011, the Drug Abuse Warning Network estimated that a
1780: pproximately 190,000 emergency department visits by persons aged
17c0:  0 to 21 years involved illicit drug use (not including alcohol)
1800: ,<sup>8</sup> and more than 79,000 of those visits were related 
1840: to nonmedical use of opioids in persons aged 12 to 25 years.<sup
1880: >9</sup> In 2015, drug overdose (both intentional and unintentio
18c0: nal) accounted for 9.7 deaths per 100,000 persons aged 15 to 24 
1900: years.<sup>10</sup></p>\r\n<p>Frequent and heavy illicit drug us
1940: e is associated with increased risk-taking behaviors while intox
1980: icated, such as driving under the influence, unsafe sexual activ
19c0: ity, and violence. In 2016, 73.6% of all deaths in young persons
1a00:  aged 10 to 24 years in the US resulted from 3 causes: unintenti
1a40: onal injuries, including motor vehicle crashes (41.1%); suicide 
1a80: (17.3%); and homicide (14.9%).<sup>3</sup> Among the leading hea
1ac0: lth risk behaviors, the use of alcohol and illicit drugs are the
1b00:  primary health risk behaviors that contribute to these causes o
1b40: f death.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<p>Illicit drug use can also have h
1b80: armful long-term consequences. Children and adolescents who init
1bc0: iate marijuana use before age 17 years are more likely to progre
1c00: ss to other drug use and drug abuse/dependence as adults compare
1c40: d with those who initiate use after age 18 years.<sup>12</sup> S
1c80: tudies have linked use of cannabis to poorer academic performanc
1cc0: e and lower education attainment (ie, dropping out of high schoo
1d00: l or not obtaining a college degree).<sup>13-15</sup> Persistent
1d40:  illicit drug use starting in adolescence has been associated wi
1d80: th negative psychosocial and neurocognitive effects, including i
1dc0: ncreased anxiety and impaired abstract thinking, attention, lear
1e00: ning, and psychomotor functioning.<sup>16,17</sup></p>\r\n<h4>Po
1e40: tential Benefits&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found inconsistent 
1e80: evidence on potential benefits associated with interventions. Th
1ec0: ere was a small, statistically significant improvement in cannab
1f00: is use specifically. However, other drug use outcomes (such as a
1f40: ny illicit drug use and the number of times used in the last 3 m

1fc0: nt. There was little evidence that interventions to prevent illi
2000: cit drug use improve health outcomes such as mortality, educatio
2040: nal attainment, or legal outcomes.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<h4>Pot
2080: ential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>The USPSTF found limited evidence on pot
20c0: ential harms associated with interventions. Only 1 study reporte

2840: ralizable to a primary care setting.</p>\r\n<p>Although alcohol 
2880: and tobacco are both psychoactive drugs, they are not the focus

2940: adolescents.<sup>6,24</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Benefits of Interventions
2980: </h3>\r\n<p>The USPSTF reviewed 29 studies (N...=...18,353) of i
29c0: nterventions to prevent illicit drug use.<sup>22,23</sup> The re
2a00: view included 26 general prevention trials and 3 trials of the F
2a40: amily Spirit program, an intensive home visitation program that 
2a80: targeted pregnant Native American/Alaska Native youth.<sup>18,25
2ac0: ,26</sup> Ten of the studies targeted middle school&ndash;aged s
2b00: tudents (aged 10-14 years) and 2 targeted young adults (aged 17-
2b40: 24 years). The remaining studies focused on high school&ndash;ag
2b80: ed youth or covered an age range inclusive of high school&ndash;
2bc0: aged youth. Most (22) of the studies were conducted in the US. R
2c00: ace/ethnicity data were not reported in all studies, although 10
2c40:  studies included a majority of black and Hispanic youth, 3 were
2c80:  limited to Native American women or girls, and 1 was limited to
2cc0:  Asian American women or girls.</p>\r\n<p>Half of the interventi
2d00: ons (50%) were individual counseling sessions (in person or by t
2d40: elephone), 21% were group sessions or a combination of group and
2d80:  individual sessions, and 35% were primarily computer based. Tri
2dc0: als in middle school&ndash;aged youth tended to be more intensiv
2e00: e, with an average of 7 to 12 sessions, compared with 1 to 3 ses
2e40: sions in older groups. Most interventions involved the youth alo
2e80: ne (68%) or the youth and the parent (23%). Common components of
2ec0:  interventions targeted to youth were education about illicit dr
2f00: ugs, other substances, or both; correction of normative thoughts
2f40:  or beliefs; and development of social skills, stress management
2f80:  skills, positive peer relationships, refusal skills, and self-e
2fc0: steem. Interventions targeted to parents included information on
3000:  youth development, communication, monitoring, establishing rule
3040: s, and positive parenting.<sup>22,23</sup></p>\r\n<p>The majorit
3080: y of trials addressed outcomes in addition to illicit drug use, 
30c0: with 9 trials focusing broadly on substance use (including alcoh
3100: ol, tobacco, or both). Other outcomes included family functionin
3140: g (8 trials), risky sexual behavior (5 trials), mental health an
3180: d emotional well-being (6 trials), truancy and delinquent behavi
31c0: ors (1 trial), and breastfeeding and infant care (3 trials).<sup
3200: >22,23</sup> Behavioral outcomes included illicit drug use (eith
3240: er any illicit drug use or frequency of use), associated alcohol
3280:  and tobacco use, delinquent behavior, risky sexual behavior, an
32c0: d unsafe driving.</p>\r\n<p>Findings were inconsistent for illic
3300: it drug use outcomes across all studies. For the general prevent
3340: ion trials (ie, those other than the Family Spirit trials), the 
3380: pooled effect of interventions on illicit drug use (including an
33c0: y drug use and number of times used) was not statistically signi

3c40: al health outcomes were reported in 12 trials and included globa
3c80: l mental health functioning (5 trials), depression symptoms (7 t
3cc0: rials), externalizing (3 trials), internalizing (1 trial), and a

3d40:  found no group-to-group differences on mental health symptom sc

0280: draft version of this Recommendation Statement was posted for pu
02c0: blic comment on the USPSTF website from October 1 through Octobe
0300: r 28, 2019. Several comments noted that the term &ldquo;prevent 
0340: or reduce&rdquo; could be interpreted as applying only to person
0380: s who have never used illicit drugs or only to those currently u
03c0: sing drugs. The primary focus of this recommendation is the prev
0400: ention of illicit drug use in children, adolescents, and young a
0440: dults who are not regular drug users (defined as drug use less t
0480: han 1 time per week). This includes persons who have never used 
04c0: drugs as well as those with early or experimental use. Changes w
0500: ere made to clarify this point.</p>\r\n<p>Comments also suggeste
0540: d that research on interventions that can be carried out in scho
0580: ols should be included. These comments also noted that the term 
05c0: &ldquo;primary care&ndash;based&rdquo; is confusing, since many 
0600: of the reviewed interventions were not carried out in a clinical
0640:  setting. The USPSTF makes recommendations on interventions that
0680:  can be conducted in or referred from a clinical setting. As suc
06c0: h, only studies that are conducted in or are judged to be genera
0700: lizable to a primary care setting were included in the review. L
0740: anguage was added to clarify this. The USPSTF wishes to emphasiz
0780: e that screening for drug use in adolescents and young adults is
07c0:  covered in a separate recommendation. As such, evidence on scre
0800: ening interventions was not reviewed in this recommendation. In 
0840: addition, the USPSTF updated the recommendation to include data 
0880: from a recent trial<sup>44</sup> that evaluated the effect of a 
08c0: computer-based intervention for the prevention of youth substanc
0900: e use and associated risky behaviors.</p><h2>Research Needs and 
0940: Gaps</h2><p>The USPSTF identified several gaps in the evidence w
0980: here more research is needed:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>There was promi
09c0: sing evidence that interventions could be effective in preventin
0a00: g cannabis use specifically; however, the benefit to harm ratio 
0a40: could not be determined because of a lack of studies reporting h
0a80: arms. Future research on cannabis prevention that deliberately a
0ac0: ddresses both benefits and harms is needed.</li>\r\n<li>There wa
0b00: s minimal reporting on health, social, or legal outcomes and sig
0b40: nificant heterogeneity in reporting on drug use outcomes. Standa
0b80: rdization of outcome measurement across trials would greatly str
0bc0: engthen the evidence base and improve the ability to pool data.<
0c00: /li>\r\n<li>Several interventions such as the Familias Unidas pr
0c40: ogram (a family-based intervention program focusing on Hispanic 
0c80: youth) and interventions that included clinician training, educa
0cc0: tion, personal coaching, and continuous quality improvement comp
0d00: onents showed promise in reducing illicit drug use. More studies
0d40:  are needed that replicate and further refine these intervention
0d80: s.</li>\r\n<li>There was no evidence on preventing or reducing i
0dc0: llicit drug use in children younger than 10 years and limited ev
0e00: idence in young adults (aged 18-25 years). More data are needed 
0e40: on the benefits and harms of interventions in these age groups.<
0e80: /li>\r\n<li>Technology-based interventions such as text-based me
0ec0: ssaging, smartphone apps, games, web-based interventions, and so
0f00: cial media have the potential for wide reach, although there are
0f40:  limited data about their effectiveness. More studies of impleme
0f80: ntation of these types of interventions is needed, specifically 
0fc0: among families referred from primary care, to determine their up
1000: take and effectiveness.</li>\r\n</ul><h2>Recommendations of Othe
1040: rs</h2><p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Adminis
1080: tration recommends that universal screening for substance use, b
10c0: rief intervention, and/or referral to treatment (SBIRT) be part 
1100: of routine health care.<sup>45</sup> In children and adolescents
1140: , &ldquo;brief interventions&rdquo; include a wide spectrum of a
1180: ctions intended to prevent, delay, or reduce substance use.<sup>
11c0: 22</sup> The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all 
1200: adolescents be screened for alcohol and illicit drug use and tha
1240: t, based on the results, clinicians conduct further assessment, 
1280: provide guidance and brief counseling interventions, and, if app
12c0: ropriate, refer for treatment.<sup>46</sup> For patients reporti
1300: ng no substance use, it recommends positive reinforcement. The C
1340: anadian Paediatric Society recommends screening and education fo
1380: r risky behaviors, including substance use.<sup>47</sup> The UK 
13c0: National Institute for Health Care Excellence recommends that cl
1400: inicians consider providing preventive drug misuse activities an
1440: d assess persons at risk of illicit drug misuse. Clinicians shou
1480: ld consider providing skills training to young persons who are a

1a00:  Public Comments</h3>\r\n<p>A draft version of this Recommendati
1a40: on Statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF web sit
1a80: e from May 12, 2020, to June 8, 2020. Several comments noted tha
1ac0: t the interventions in studies were mainly provided by nonmedica
1b00: l professionals and requested clarification on which types of pr
1b40: ofessionals could provide these services. The USPSTF recognizes 
1b80: that many of the studied interventions were carried out by nonph
1bc0: ysicians and that multiple types of professionals, both medical 
1c00: and nonmedical, can deliver them. Language was added to clarify 
1c40: this point. Respondents also suggested that the recommendation h
1c80: ighlight certain interventions such as low-carbohydrate and plan
1cc0: t-based diets, intermittent fasting, telehealth, and wearable te
1d00: chnologies. The USPSTF reviewed studies that included a wide ran
1d40: ge of healthy dietary advice; however, only the DASH and Mediter
1d80: ranean diets were examined in more than 1 study. Additionally, r
1dc0: ecommendations from plant-based and low-carbohydrate diets are i
1e00: ncluded in most recommendations for a healthy diet. There were l
1e40: imited studies on telemedicine-based interventions and wearable 
1e80: technology. The USPSTF calls for more research in these areas.</
1ec0: p>\r\n<p>Several comments noted the disparities among patient po
1f00: pulations in access to healthy food and requested more informati
1f40: on on how to provide behavioral counseling services to diverse p
1f80: opulations. The USPSTF recognizes that there are large dispariti
1fc0: es in access to resources that support a healthy diet and increa
2000: sed physical activity. The recommendation statement includes lin
2040: ks to resources (eg, The Community Guide) that may help address 
2080: these issues. Additionally, the USPSTF calls for more research o
20c0: n low-intensity approaches that work best in lower-resource sett
2100: ings.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>The USPSTF identifie
2140: d several gaps in the evidence where more research is needed.</p
2180: >\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Very few trials had sufficient sample size and 
21c0: follow-up to assess the effect on CVD events such as myocardial 
2200: infarction or stroke and mortality. Larger studies with longer-t
2240: erm follow-up would be valuable to assess the effect of interven
2280: tions on these outcomes.</li>\r\n<li>Reporting of behavioral out
22c0: comes was highly variable and often incomplete. Greater consiste
2300: ncy and standardization of outcomes, specifically those for phys
2340: ical activity and diet, are needed to better understand the rang
2380: e of effects and interpret the pooled effects.</li>\r\n<li>There
23c0:  was little literature on the use of technologies such as wearab
2400: le activity trackers. These may be useful tools to increase enga
2440: gement in physical activity as well as for providing objective d
2480: ata on physical activity outcomes. In addition, more studies are
24c0:  needed that include online resources such as daily caloric inta
2500: ke applications or other low-intensity approaches that may be va
2540: luable in low-resource settings.</li>\r\n<li>Despite the large n
2580: umber of included trials reviewed by the USPSTF, there were few 
25c0: replication studies. Large replication studies of interventions 
2600: showing reductions in CVD events are urgently needed.</li>\r\n</
2640: ul><h2>Recommendations of Others</h2><p>Numerous organizations, 
2680: including the American Heart Association/American College of Car
26c0: diology, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and the US Depa

2780: <sup>17-19</sup> Most recommend that adults adhere to a healthy 
27c0: diet that includes a balanced diet low in sodium and saturated f

2880: recommend that clinicians use counseling interventions to promot
28c0: e a healthy diet and physical activity (consistent with US Food 
2900: and Drug Administration/Department of Health and Human Services 
2940: guidelines) for all adults.<sup>17</sup> For adults with elevate

0180: ned as sustained high blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure (p
01c0: reviously known as prehypertension) in children aged 1 to 13 yea
0200: rs is defined as 3 auscultatory blood pressure measurements betw
0240: een the 90th and 94th percentile based on age, height, and sex, 
0280: or 120 to 129/&lt;80 mm Hg.<sup>8</sup> For children aged 1 to 1
02c0: 3 years, hypertension is defined as 3 auscultatory blood pressur
0300: e measurements at 3 different visits that are either equal to or
0340:  above the 95th percentile based on age, height, and sex or abov
0380: e 130/80 mm Hg, whichever measurement is lower.<sup>1,8</sup> Th

0540: eening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Best practice is to measure blood pressu
0580: re by auscultation of the upper right arm with an appropriately 
05c0: sized cuff<sup>1,8</sup> at 3 different visits. (The right arm i
0600: s preferred in children because standardized blood pressure tabl
0640: es reflect right arm readings and because low readings in the le
0680: ft arm could be a result of coarctation of the aorta.) Some orga
06c0: nizations suggest that, as in adults, the diagnosis should be co
0700: nfirmed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). ABPM use
0740: s portable devices that record blood pressure measurements at re
0780: gular intervals (usually every 20 to 30 minutes) over 12 to 24 h
07c0: ours.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>Ther
0800: e is no good evidence about how often blood pressure should be m
0840: easured in children and adolescents.</p>\r\n<h3>Treatment</h3>\r
0880: \n<p>Hypertension in children is often treated with lifestyle an
08c0: d pharmacologic interventions. Lifestyle interventions for hyper
0900: tension include weight loss in children who are overweight or ob
0940: ese, increased physical activity, and the Dietary Approaches to 
0980: Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, as well as education and counseli
09c0: ng. Medication is generally used to treat hypertension that is u
0a00: nresponsive to lifestyle modification or that has a secondary ca
0a40: use.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding t
0a80: he I Statement</h3>\r\n<p>In deciding whether to screen for high
0ac0:  blood pressure in children and adolescents, clinicians should c
0b00: onsider the following.</p>\r\n<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</
0b40: h4>\r\n<p>Important risk factors for primary hypertension in chi
0b80: ldren and adolescents are higher body mass index and a family hi
0bc0: story of hypertension. Other risk factors include low birth weig
0c00: ht, male sex, and African American or Hispanic/Latino race/ethni
0c40: city. The increasing prevalence of hypertension in children and 
0c80: adolescents, possibly driven by childhood obesity, suggests that
0cc0:  identification and treatment of hypertension may become a signi
0d00: ficant health care issue. The goal of identifying and treating c
0d40: hildren and adolescents with primary hypertension can be viewed 
0d80: within a larger framework of adult cardiovascular risk reduction
0dc0: , which includes addressing other biometric risk factors such as
0e00:  higher body mass index and lipid profiles and hyperglycemia. Ho
0e40: wever, the variables for cardiovascular risk reduction in childr
0e80: en are less understood than in adults.</p>\r\n<p>Extending the a
0ec0: dult framework for cardiovascular risk reduction to children and
0f00:  adolescents is limited by several methodological challenges tha
0f40: t complicate the determination of the potential preventable burd
0f80: en. There is limited evidence about the clinical and epidemiolog
0fc0: ic significance of percentile thresholds used in children in ter
1000: ms of their association with adult cardiovascular disease. In ad
1040: dition, the performance characteristics of current methods for d
1080: iagnosing hypertension during childhood are limited and of conce
10c0: rn because of possible high false-positive rates (ie, elevated b
1100: lood pressure measurements that later normalize).</p>\r\n<p>One 
1140: justification that has been suggested for screening is to identi
1180: fy secondary hypertension, a relatively rare condition. Younger 
11c0: children (younger than 6 years) are more likely than older child
1200: ren and adolescents to have a secondary cause of hypertension, s
1240: uch as renal disease, coarctation of the aorta, or endocrine dis
1280: ease. Secondary hypertension is unlikely to be the only clinical
12c0:  manifestation of the underlying disorder in these cases, and ma
1300: nagement is primarily targeted at treating the underlying condit
1340: ion, as well as controlling hypertension.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<h4
1380: >Potential Harms</h4>\r\n<p>Clinic-based screening for high bloo
13c0: d pressure could result in false-positive results. Thus, unneces
1400: sary secondary evaluations or treatments may be common, particul

33c0: The USPSTF recognizes that the most effective strategy for reduc
3400: ing HIV-related morbidity and mortality in the United States is 
3440: primary prevention, or avoidance of exposure to HIV infection. A
3480: voiding behaviors that may convey an increased risk of HIV infec
34c0: tion and consistent use of condoms can decrease the risk of tran
3500: smission of HIV and other STIs. The USPSTF recommends providing 
3540: intensive behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolesce
3580: nts and for adults at increased risk of STIs.<sup>14</sup></p>\r
35c0: \n\r\n<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force has made s
3600: everal recommendations related to the prevention of HIV/AIDS and
3640:  other STIs.<sup>15</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prophylactic interventio
3680: n with antiretroviral medications, both preexposure and postexpo
36c0: sure, can prevent HIV infection. Postexposure prophylaxis is use
3700: d in persons who do not have HIV and may have been exposed to it
3740:  via sexual contact, occupational or nonoccupational needle stic
3780: k or other injury, or sharing injection drug equipment. When ini
37c0: tiated soon after possible exposure, postexposure prophylaxis ca
3800: n prevent HIV infection. Preexposure prophylaxis is used in pers
3840: ons who do not have HIV and are at high risk of acquiring HIV in
3880: fection. It consists of antiretroviral medication taken every da
38c0: y, before potential exposure. The USPSTF recommends offering pre

2d40: nt of Risk</h3>\r\n<p>The risk for HBV infection varies substant
2d80: ially by country of origin in non&ndash;US-born persons living i

2e00: is B surface antigen (HBsAg) of 2% or greater (<a href=\"#tab2\"
2e40: >Table 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig\">Figure</a>) account for the major
2e80: ity of cases of new chronic HBV infection in the US; most person
2ec0: s in these countries acquired HBV infection from perinatal trans

2f40: gions with higher prevalence are also at increased risk of HBV i
2f80: nfection during birth or early childhood, particularly if they d
2fc0: o not receive appropriate passive and active immunoprophylaxis (
3000: and antiviral therapy for pregnant women with a high viral load)

30c0: 8%], moderate [2%-7%], or low [&lt;2%]) (<a href=\"#fig\">Figure
3100: </a>). The estimated prevalence of HBV infection in the general 
3140: US population is 0.3% to 0.5%,<sup>8,9,11,12,14,15</sup> which m
3180: akes it reasonable to screen adolescents and adults born in coun

3600: \n<h3>Screening Tests</h3>\r\n<p>Screening for hepatitis B shoul
3640: d be performed with HBsAg tests approved by the US Food and Drug

3800: \n<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>\r\n<p>For patients with negative 
3840: HBsAg results who have not received the HBV vaccine series, peri
3880: odic screening may be useful for those who report continued risk
38c0:  for acquiring HBV transmission, such as persons who continue to
3900:  inject drugs and men who have sex with men. Clinical judgment s
3940: hould be used to determine screening frequency. The USPSTF found
3980:  no evidence to determine optimal screening intervals.</p>\r\n<h
39c0: 3>Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Persons with testing results indicative o
3a00: f acute or chronic HBV infection generally receive education abo
3a40: ut reducing the risk of transmission to others (eg, during child

2380: other enrolled participants with no history of cerebrovascular e
23c0: vents in the distribution of the ipsilateral carotid artery and 
2400: no symptoms referable to the contralateral artery for the past 4
2440: 5 days. Medical therapy varied by trial and may not reflect cont
2480: emporary aggressive risk factor modification, and operators (eg,
24c0:  surgeons and interventionists) were highly selected based on th
2500: eir low morbidity and mortality rates.<sup>8</sup> Because of th

36c0: sion of this recommendation statement was posted for public comm
3700: ent on the USPSTF website from August 4, 2020, to August 31, 202
3740: 0. Several comments noted that the term &ldquo;general adult pop
3780: ulation&rdquo; includes patients who may be at increased risk fo
37c0: r carotid artery stenosis or stroke and noted that other organiz
3800: ations recommend screening in these higher-risk individuals. Sev
3840: eral risk factors for developing carotid artery stenosis are not
3880: ed in the recommendation, including hypertension, diabetes, smok
38c0: ing, and hypercholesterolemia. The studies included in the revie
3900: w included participants with these risk factors, and the USPSTF 
3940: found no benefit in screening asymptomatic populations. The USPS
3980: TF added language to clarify this point. No reliable tools are a
39c0: vailable to determine which individuals are at increased risk fo
3a00: r carotid artery stenosis or are at increased risk of stroke whe
3a40: n carotid artery stenosis is present. Respondents questioned the
3a80:  USPSTF&rsquo;s conclusions regarding the harms associated with 
3ac0: surgical interventions and the comparative benefit of best medic
3b00: al therapy vs CEA. Comments pointed to several studies that demo
3b40: nstrate the benefits of CEA over best medical therapy to reduce 
3b80: stroke risk in asymptomatic persons. Comments also noted that ne
3bc0: w, safer procedures are now available (ie, transcarotid artery r
3c00: evascularization) that were not reviewed and that may shift the 
3c40: balance of net benefit. The USPSTF reviewed all available eviden
3c80: ce and concluded that the magnitude of benefit would be smaller 
3cc0: in truly asymptomatic persons in the general population than amo
3d00: ng selected patients in trials. The USPSTF added language about 
3d40: the new studies it considered. The review found no studies that 
3d80: examined the benefits and harms of transcarotid artery revascula
3dc0: rization.</p><h2>Research Needs and Gaps</h2><p>More research is
